Dear Sir,

Please refer to paragraph 11 of the Third Bi-Monthly  Monetary Policy Statement, 2014-15 (
extract enclosed
) announced on  August 5, 2014 relating to banks’ total holdings of SLR securities in the held  to maturity (HTM) category.
2. In terms of para 1.2 of our
circular RPCD.CO.RRB.BC.No.  74/03.05.33/2013-14 dated January 07, 2014
on ‘Guidelines for  Classification, Valuation and Provisioning’, RRBs were permitted to exceed the limit of 25.00  per cent of total investments under the HTM category provided the excess  comprised only SLR securities and the total SLR securities held in the HTM  category was not more than 24.50 per cent of their NDTL as on last Friday of  the second preceding fortnight.
3. In consonance with the calibrated reduction  in the SLR and in order to enable RRBs greater participation in financial  markets, the above ceiling for SLR holdings in HTM category is being brought  down to 24 per cent of NDTL with effect from the fortnight beginning August 9,  2014. Accordingly, it is advised that with effect from August 9, 2014, RRBs are  permitted to exceed the limit of 25 per cent of total investments under HTM  category provided the excess comprises only SLR securities, and the total SLR securities held in the  HTM category is not more than 24.00 per cent of their NDTL as on the last  Friday of the second preceding fortnight.
4. As per extant instructions, banks may shift  investments to/from HTM with the approval of the Board of Directors once a year  and such shifting will normally be allowed at the beginning of the accounting  year. In order to enable banks to shift their excess SLR securities from the  HTM category to AFS/HFT category in compliance with the instructions indicated  in paragraph 3 above, it has been decided to allow one more such shifting by  August 9, 2014.
Yours faithfully
