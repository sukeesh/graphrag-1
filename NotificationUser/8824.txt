Madam / Dear Sir,
Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms /Anti-Money  Laundering (AML) Standards/ Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT)/  Obligation of banks under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 –  Harmonization of KYC norms for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs)
Please refer to the
first Bi-Monthly Monetary  Policy Statement, 2014-15
wherein, inter-alia, it has been proposed to simplify  the KYC related procedure for opening bank accounts by FPIs.
2. Consequent to the Budget proposal for the year  2013-2014 and the recent amendments to the Prevention of Money Laundering  (Maintenance of Records) Rules, 2005 (Rules), Securities and Exchange Board of  India (SEBI) has rationalised the KYC norms for entry of FPIs (vide their  circular MIRSD/07/2013 dated September 12, 2013). Reserve Bank has been  receiving suggestions regarding rationalisation of KYC norms in case of FPIs  for opening bank accounts along the similar lines. The matter has since been  examined in consultation with the Government and it has been decided to simplify  the KYC norms in the case of FPIs.
3. FPIs have been categorized by SEBI based on  their perceived risk profile as detailed in
Annex I
. In terms of Rule 9 (14)(i)  of the Rules, simplified norms have been prescribed for those FPIs who have  been duly registered in accordance with SEBI guidelines and have undergone the  required KYC due diligence/verification prescribed by SEBI through a  Custodian/Intermediary regulated by SEBI. Such eligible/registered FPIs may  approach a bank for opening a bank account for the purpose of investment under  Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS) for which KYC documents prescribed by the  Reserve Bank (as detailed in
Annex II
) would be required. For this purpose,  banks may rely on the KYC verification done by the third party (i.e. the Custodian/SEBI  Regulated Intermediary) subject to the conditions laid down in Rule 9 (2) [(a)  to (e)] of the Rules.
4. In this regard, SEBI has been requested to  advise Custodians/Intermediaries regulated by them to share the relevant KYC  documents with the banks concerned based on written authorization from the  FPIs. Accordingly, a set of hard copies of the relevant KYC documents furnished  by the FPIs to the Custodians/Regulated Intermediaries may be transferred to  the concerned bank through their authorised representative. While transferring  such documents, the Custodian/Regulated Intermediary shall certify that the  documents have been duly verified with the original or notarised documents have  been obtained, where applicable. In this regard, a proper record of transfer of  documents, both at the level of the Custodian/Regulated Intermediary as well as  at the bank, under signatures of the officials of the transferor and transferee  entities, may be kept. While opening bank accounts for FPIs in terms of the  above procedure, banks may bear in mind that they are ultimately responsible  for the customer due diligence done by the third party (i.e. the  Custodian/Regulated Intermediary) and may need to take enhanced due diligence  measures, as applicable, if required. Further, banks are required to obtain  undertaking from FPIs or a Global Custodian acting on behalf of the FPI to the  effect that as and when required, the exempted documents as detailed in Annex  II will be submitted.
5. It is further advised that to facilitate secondary  market transactions, the bank may share the KYC documents received from the FPI  or certified copies received from a Custodian/Regulated Intermediary with other  banks/regulated market intermediaries based on written authorization from the  FPI.
6. The provisions of this circular are applicable  for both new and existing FPI clients. These provisions are applicable only for  PIS by FPIs. In case the FPIs intend to use the bank account opened under the  above procedure for any other approved activities (i.e. other than PIS), they  would have to undergo KYC drill as prescribed in our
Master  Circular DBOD.AML.BC.No. 24/14.01.001/2013-14 dated July 1, 2013
on Know  Your Customer (KYC) norms / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards/Combating of  Financing of Terrorism (CFT)/Obligation of banks under PMLA, 2002.
7. Banks may revise their KYC policy in the light  of the above instructions and ensure strict adherence to the same.
Yours faithfully,
(Prakash Chandra  Sahoo)
