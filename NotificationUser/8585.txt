Madam  / Sir
Overseas Foreign Currency Borrowings by  Authorised Dealer Banks
Attention of AD category I  banks is invited to
AP (DIR Series) circulars no. 40 dated September 10, 2013
read with
AP (DIR Series) Circular no. 61 dated October 10, 2013
in terms of  which they were permitted to borrow from international/multilateral financial  institutions up to 100 percent of their Tier-I capital subject to the  conditions mentioned therein and also swap the borrowed amount with the Reserve  Bank  at a concessional rate as mentioned therein. As per the said  circulars both the permissions to borrow from the international/multilateral  financial institutions as well as to swap it with Reserve Bank were valid till  November 30, 2013.
2. It has been brought to  the Bank’s notice that some banks may be in the process of negotiation of loans  from international/multilateral financial institutions and may not be in a  position to draw the loan and deliver the same to RBI as a part of the  concessional swap within November 30, 2013. In this context, it has been  decided that if any bank is being sanctioned any loan from any  international/multilateral financial institutions and is receiving a firm  commitment in this
regard on or before November 30, 2013
, it will be  allowed to enter into a forward-forward swap under the first leg of which  the bank will sell forward the contracted amount of foreign currency  corresponding to the loan amount for delivery up to December 31, 2013.  However, if the bank is not in a position to deliver the contracted amount of  foreign currency on the contracted date, it would have to pay the difference  between concessional swap rate contracted and the market swap rate plus one  hundred basis points. The other terms and conditions for the swap will remain  unchanged as notified earlier.
3. It is reiterated that  the above relaxation is available only for the contracts entered into up to November 30, 2013 and not thereafter.
4. The direction contained in this circular has been issued under  sections 10(4) and 11(1) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of  1999) and is without prejudice to permissions / approvals, if any, required  under any other law.
Yours faithfully
