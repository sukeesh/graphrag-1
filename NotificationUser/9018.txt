The Government of India  has enacted the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act,  2006 on June 16, 2006 which was notified on October 2, 2006. With the enactment  of MSMED Act 2006, the paradigm shift that has taken place is the inclusion of  the services sector in the definition of Micro, Small & Medium enterprises,  apart from extending the scope to medium enterprises. The MSMED Act, 2006 has  modified the definition of micro, small and medium enterprises engaged in  manufacturing or production and providing or rendering of services. The Reserve  Bank has notified the changes to all scheduled commercial banks. Further, the  definition, as per the Act, has been adopted for purposes of bank credit vide  RBI
circular  ref. RPCD.PLNFS. BC.No.63/ 06.02.31/ 2006-07 dated April 4, 2007
.
1.1 Definition  of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises
(a)

2 Scheme  of Small Enterprises Financial Centres (SEFCs):
As per announcement made  by the Governor in the Annual Policy Statement 2005-06, a scheme for strategic  alliance between branches of banks and SIDBI located in clusters, named as  “Small Enterprises Financial Centres” has been formulated in consultation with  the Ministry of SSI and Banking Division, Ministry of Finance, Government of  India, SIDBI, IBA and select banks and circulated to all scheduled commercial  banks on May 20, 2005 for implementation. SIDBI has so far executed MoU with 15  banks (Bank of India, UCO Bank, YES Bank, Bank of Baroda, Oriental Bank of  Commerce, Punjab National Bank, Dena Bank, Andhra Bank, Indian Bank,  Corporation Bank, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Union Bank of India, State  Bank of India and Federal Bank). List of MSME clusters covered by existing  SIDBI branches is furnished in
Annex II
.
SECTION - III
3 Targets  for lending to Micro and Small  enterprises (MSE) sector by Domestic Commercial  Banks and Foreign Banks  operating in India
3.1
Advances to micro and small enterprises  (MSE) sector shall be reckoned in computing achievement under the overall  Priority Sector target of 40 percent (32 percent for Foreign Banks operating in  India with less than 20 branches) of Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or credit  equivalent amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposure, whichever is higher.
3.2
Bank loans above Rs.5 crore per borrower  / unit to Micro and Small Enterprises engaged in providing or rendering of  services and defined in terms of investment in equipment under MSMED Act, 2006,  shall
not
be reckoned in computing achievement under the overall  above Priority Sector targets. However, such loans would be taken into account  while assessing the performance of the banks with regard to their achievement  of targets prescribed by the Prime Minister’s  Task Force on MSMEs for lending to MSE sector.
3.3
In  terms of the recommendations of the Prime Minister’s Task Force on MSMEs, banks  are advised to achieve a 20 per cent year-on-year growth in credit to micro and  small enterprises and a 10 per cent annual growth in the number of micro  enterprise accounts.
3.4
In order to ensure that sufficient credit  is available to micro enterprises within the MSE sector, banks should ensure  that:
(a) 40 per cent of the total advances  to MSE sector should go to micro (manufacturing) enterprises having investment  in plant and machinery up to Rs. 10 lakh and micro (service) enterprises having  investment in equipment up to Rs. 4 lakh;
(b) 20 per cent of the total advances  to MSE sector should go to micro (manufacturing) enterprises with investment in  plant and machinery above Rs. 10 lakh and up to Rs. 25 lakh, and micro  (service) enterprises with investment in equipment above Rs. 4 lakh and up to  Rs. 10 lakh.
Thus, 60 per cent of MSE  advances should go to the micro enterprises.
(c) While  banks are advised to achieve the 60% target as above, in terms of the  recommendations of the Prime Minister’s Task Force, the allocation of 60% of  the MSE advances to the micro enterprises is to be achieved in stages viz. 50%  in the year 2010-11, 55% in the year 2011-12 and 60% in the year 2012-13.
3.5
The target for lending to Micro  Enterprises within the MSE sector (i.e. 60% of total lending to MSE sector  should go to Micro enterprises) will be computed with reference to the  outstanding credit to MSE sector as on preceding March 31st.
SECTION - IV
4 Common  Guidelines / Instructions for Lending to MSME Sector
4.1 Issue  of Acknowledgement of Loan Applications to MSME borrowers
Banks have been advised  to mandatorily acknowledge all loan applications, submitted manually or online,  by their MSME borrowers and ensure that a running serial number is recorded on  the application form as well as on the acknowledgement receipt. Banks are  further encouraged to start Central Registration of loan applications. The same  technology may be used for online submission of loan applications as also for  online tracking of loan applications.
4.2 Collateral
Banks are mandated not  to accept collateral security in the case of loans upto Rs.10 lakh extended to  units in the MSE sector. Banks are also advised to extend collateral-free loans  upto Rs. 10 lakh to all units financed under the Prime Minister Employment  Generation Programme of KVIC.
Banks may, on the basis  of good track record and financial position of the MSE units, increase the  limit of dispensation of collateral requirement for loans up to Rs.25 lakh  (with the approval of the appropriate authority).
Banks are advised to  strongly encourage their branch level functionaries to avail of the Credit  Guarantee Scheme cover, including making performance in this regard a criterion  in the evaluation of their field staff.
4.3 Composite  loan
A composite loan limit  of Rs.1 crore can be sanctioned by banks to enable the MSE entrepreneurs to  avail of their working capital and term loan requirement through Single Window.
4.4 Specialised  MSME branches
Public sector banks have  been advised to open at least one specialised branch in each district. Further,  banks have been permitted to categorise their MSME general banking branches  having 60% or more of their advances to MSME sector in order to encourage them  to open more specialised MSME branches for providing better service to this  sector as a whole. As per the policy package announced by the Government of  India for stepping up credit to MSME sector, the public sector banks will  ensure specialized MSME branches in identified clusters/centres with  preponderance of small enterprises to enable the entrepreneurs to have easy access  to the bank credit and to equip bank personnel to develop requisite expertise.  The existing specialised SSI branches may also be redesignated as MSME  branches. Though their core competence will be  utilized for extending finance and other services to MSME sector, they will  have operational flexibility to extend finance/render other services to other  sectors/borrowers.
4.5 Delayed  Payment
Under the Amendment Act,  1998 of Interest on Delayed Payment to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial  Undertakings, penal provisions have been incorporated to take care of delayed  payments to MSME units. After the enactment of the Micro, Small and Medium  Enterprises Development (MSMED), Act 2006, the existing provisions of the  Interest on Delayed Payment Act, 1998 to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial  Undertakings, have been strengthened as under:
(i) The buyer has to make payment to the  supplier on or before the date agreed upon between him and the supplier in  writing or, in case of no agreement, before the appointed day. The period  agreed upon between the supplier and the buyer shall not exceed forty five days  from the date of acceptance or the day of deemed acceptance.
(ii) In case the buyer fails to make payment  of the amount to the supplier, he shall be liable to pay compound interest with  monthly rests to the supplier on the amount from the appointed day or, on the  date agreed on, at three times of the Bank Rate notified by Reserve Bank.
(iii) For any goods supplied or services  rendered by the supplier, the buyer shall be liable to pay the interest as  advised at (ii) above.
(iv) In case of dispute with regard to any  amount due, a reference shall be made to the Micro and Small Enterprises  Facilitation Council, constituted by the respective State Government.
Further, banks have been advised to fix sub-limits  within the overall working capital limits to the large borrowers specifically  for meeting the payment obligation in respect of purchases from MSMEs.
4.6 Revised  Guidelines for Rehabilitation of Sick Micro and Small Enterprises
In view of the recommendations  of Working Group on rehabilitation of potentially viable sick units (Chairman:  Dr. K. C. Chakrabarty), regarding changing the definition of sickness and the procedure  for assessing the viability of sick MSE units, a Committee was set up by the Ministry of MSME to look into the issue. Based  on the recommendation of the Committee, revised guidelines for rehabilitation  of sick units in the MSE sector have been issued vide our
circular RPCD.CO.MSME &  NFS.BC.40/06.02.31/2012-2013 dated November 1, 2012
.
The objective of the  revised guidelines is to hasten the process of identification of a unit as  sick, early detection of incipient sickness, and to lay down a procedure to be  adopted by banks before declaring a unit as unviable.
As per the new  guidelines, a  Micro or Small Enterprise (as defined in the MSMED Act 2006) may be said to  have become Sick, if (a) any of the borrowal account of the enterprise remains  NPA for three months or more OR (b) there is erosion in the net worth due to  accumulated losses to the extent of 50% of its net worth during the previous  accounting year.
The revised guidelines also  provide the procedures to be adopted by the banks before declaring any unit as  unviable. Banks have been advised that the decision on viability of the unit  should be taken at the earliest but not later than 3 months of becoming sick  under any circumstances and the rehabilitation package should be fully  implemented within six months from the date the unit is declared as  'potentially viable' / 'viable'.
4.7 Micro and Small Enterprises Sector – The  imperative of Financial Literacy and consultancy support
Keeping in view the high  extent of financial exclusion (92 per cent) in the MSME sector, it is  imperative for banks that the excluded units are brought within the fold of the  formal banking sector. The lack of financial literacy, operational skills,  including accounting and finance, business planning etc. represent formidable  challenge for MSE borrowers underscoring the need for facilitation by banks in  these critical financial areas. Moreover, MSE enterprises are further  handicapped in this regard by absence of scale and size. To effectively and  decisively address these handicaps, Scheduled commercial banks have been  advised vide our
circular RPCD.MSME &  NFS.BC.No.20/06.02.31/2012-13 dated August 1, 2012
that the banks could either separately set up  special cells at their branches, or vertically integrate this function in the  Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs) set up by them, as per their comparative  advantage. The bank staff should also be trained through customised training  programs to meet the specific needs of the sector.
4.8 Structured  Mechanism for monitoring the credit growth to the MSE sector
In view of the concerns  emerging from the deceleration in credit growth to the MSE sector, an Indian  Banking Association (IBA)-led Sub-Committee (Chairman: Shri K.R. Kamath) was  set up to suggest a structured mechanism to be put in place by banks to monitor  the entire gamut of credit related issues pertaining to the sector. Based on  the recommendations of the Committee, banks have been advised to:
strengthen their  existing systems of monitoring credit growth to the sector and put in place a  system-driven comprehensive performance management information system (MIS) at  every supervisory level (branch, region, zone, head office) which should be  critically evaluated on a regular basis;
put in place a  system of e-tracking of MSE loan applications and monitor the loan application  disposal process in banks, giving branch-wise, region-wise, zone-wise and  State-wise positions. The position in this regard is to be displayed by banks  on their websites; and
monitor timely rehabilitation of sick MSE units.  The progress in rehabilitation of sick MSE units is to be made available on the  website of banks.
Detailed guidelines have  been issued to the scheduled commercial banks vide our
circular RPCD. MSME&NFS.BC.No. 74  /06.02.31/2012-13 dated May 9, 2013
.
4.9 Revised  General Credit Card (GCC) Scheme
In  order to enhance the coverage of GCC Scheme to ensure greater credit linkage  for all productive activities within the overall Priority Sector guidelines and  to capture all credit extended by banks to individuals for non-farm  entrepreneurial activity, the GCC guidelines have been revised on December 2,  2013.
4.10 State Level Inter Institutional Committee
In order to deal with  the problems of co-ordination for rehabilitation of sick micro and small units,  State Level Inter-Institutional Committees (SLIICs) were set up in the States. However,  the matter of continuation or otherwise, of the SLIIC Forum has been left to  the individual States / Union Territory. The meetings of these Committees are  convened by Regional Offices of RBI and presided over by the Secretary,  Industry of the concerned State Government. It provides a useful forum for  adequate interfacing between the State Government Officials and State Level  Institutions on the one side and the term lending institutions and banks on the  other. It closely monitors timely sanction of working capital to units which  have been provided term loans by SFCs, implementation of special schemes such  as Margin Money Scheme of State Government and reviews general problems faced  by industries and sickness in MSE sector based on the data furnished by banks.  Among others, the representatives of the local state level MSE associations are  invited to the meetings of SLIIC which are held quarterly. A sub-committee of  SLIIC looks into the problems of individual sick MSE unit and submits its  recommendations to the forum of SLIIC for consideration.
4.11 Empowered  Committee on MSMEs
As part of the  announcement made by the Union Finance Minister, at the Regional Offices of  Reserve Bank of India, Empowered Committees on MSMEs have been constituted  under the Chairmanship of the Regional Directors with the representatives of  SLBC Convenor, senior level officers from two banks having predominant share in  MSME financing in the state, representative of SIDBI Regional Office, the  Director of Industries of the State Government, one or two senior level  representatives from the MSME/SSI Associations in the state, and a senior level  officer from SFC/SIDC as members. The Committee will meet periodically and  review the progress in MSME financing as also rehabilitation of sick Micro,  Small and Medium units. It will also coordinate with other banks/financial  institutions and the state government in removing bottlenecks, if any, to  ensure smooth flow of credit to the sector. The committees may decide the need  to have similar committees at cluster/district levels.
4.12 Debt  Restructuring Mechanism for MSMEs
(i) As part of  announcement made by the Hon'ble Finance Minister for stepping up credit to  small and medium enterprises, a debt restructuring mechanism for units in MSME  sector has been formulated by Department of Banking Operations &  Development of Reserve Bank of India and advised all commercial banks vide
circular  DBOD.BP.BC.No. 34/21.04.132/2005-06 dated September 8, 2005
. These detailed guidelines have been issued to  ensure restructuring of debt of all eligible small and medium enterprises.  These guidelines would be applicable to the following entities, which are  viable or potentially viable:
(a)  All non-corporate MSMEs irrespective of the level of dues to banks.

(iii) Banks have been advised to give wide  publicity to the One Time settlement scheme implemented by them, by placing it  on the bank’s website and through other possible modes of dissemination. They  may allow reasonable time to the borrowers to submit the application and also  make payment of the dues in order to extend the benefits of the scheme to  eligible borrowers.
4.13 Cluster  Approach
(i) 60 clusters have  been identified by the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises,  Government of India for focused development of Small Enterprises sector. All  SLBC Convenor banks have been advised to incorporate in their Annual Credit  Plans, the credit requirement in the clusters identified by the Ministry of  Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Government of India.
As per Ganguly Committee  recommendations banks have been advised that a full-service approach to cater  to the diverse needs of the MSE sector may be achieved through extending  banking services to recognized MSE clusters by adopting a 4-C approach namely,  Customer focus, Cost control, Cross sell and Contain risk. A cluster based  approach to lending may be more beneficial:
(a) in dealing with well-defined and recognized  groups;
(b) availability of appropriate information for risk  assessment and
(c) monitoring by the lending institutions.
Clusters may be  identified based on factors such as trade record, competitiveness and growth  prospects and/or other cluster specific data.
(ii) As per announcement made by the  Governor in paragraph 157 of the Annual Policy Statement 2007-08, all SLBC  Convenor banks have been advised vide letter RPCD.PLNFS.No. 10416/06.02.31/  2006-07 dated May 8, 2007 to review their institutional arrangements for  delivering credit to the MSME sector, especially in 388 clusters identified by  United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) spread over 21  states in various parts of the country.
