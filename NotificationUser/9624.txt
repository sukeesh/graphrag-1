Madam/Dear Sir,
Utilisation of Floating  Provisions/Counter Cyclical Provisioning Buffer
Please refer to our
circular  DBOD.No.BP.BC.89/21.04.048/2005-06 dated June 22, 2006
and
DBOD.No.BP.BC.68/21.04.048/2006-07 dated March 13, 2007
on creation,  accounting, disclosures and utilisation of floating provisions by banks. Banks  may also refer to our
circular No.DBOD.No.BP.BC.87/21.04.048/2010-11  dated April 21, 2011
on creation and utilisation of ‘countercyclical provisioning  buffer’, wherein we had advised that the buffer will be allowed to be used by  banks for making specific provisions for non-performing assets, inter alia,  during periods of system wide downturn, with the prior approval of RBI.
2. Accordingly, in terms of our circular dated  February 7, 2014, banks were allowed to utilise upto 33 per cent of  countercyclical provisioning buffer/floating provisions held by them as on  March 31, 2013, for making specific provisions for non-performing assets, as  per the policy approved by their Board of Directors.
3. Further to this, it has now been decided, as a  counter cyclical measure, to allow banks to utilise upto 50 per cent of  countercyclical provisioning buffer/floating provisions held by them as at the  end of December 31, 2014, for making specific provisions for non-performing  assets, as per the policy approved by their Board of Directors.
4. Utilisation of countercyclical provisioning  buffer/floating provisions under this measure would be over and above the  utilisation of countercyclical provisioning buffer/floating provisions as  permitted vide
circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.98 / 21.04.132/2013-14 dated February  26, 2014
on ‘Framework for Revitalising Distressed Assets in the Economy -  Refinancing of Project Loans, Sale of NPA and Other Regulatory Measures’.
Yours faithfully,
(Sudarshan Sen)
