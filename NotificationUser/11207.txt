2. Further, although two new districts “East Kamrup” and “South Kamrup” have been published in the Gazette Notification dated February 26, 2016, these two districts are still non-functional as per the communication received from the Government of Assam. Lead bank responsibility will hence be assigned separately for these districts.
3. The District Working Codes of the new districts have been allotted for the purpose of BSR reporting by banks.
4. There is no change in the lead bank responsibilities of the other districts in the State of Assam.
Yours faithfully
