regarding requirement of ‘proof of address’  while opening a bank account by individuals.
2. Reserve Bank of India has been receiving  representations/references from various quarters especially migrant workers,  transferred employees, etc., regarding problems faced in submitting a proof of  current/permanent address while opening a bank account. The matter has since  been examined in the light of amendment to the Prevention of Money Laundering  Rules (Maintenance of Records), 2005, and accordingly, it has been decided to  simplify the requirement of submission of ‘proof of address’ as follows:
a) Henceforth, customers may submit only one  documentary proof of address (either current or permanent) while opening a bank  account or while undergoing periodic updation. In case the address mentioned as  per ‘proof of address’ undergoes a change, fresh proof of address may be  submitted to the branch within a period of six months.
b) In case the proof of address furnished by the  customer is not the local address or address where the customer is currently  residing, the RRB/StCB/CCB may take a declaration of  the local address on which all correspondence will be made by the bank with the  customer. No proof is required to be submitted for such address for  correspondence / local address. This address may be verified by the bank  through ‘positive confirmation’ such as acknowledgment of receipt of (i) letter,  cheque books, ATM cards; (ii) telephonic conversation; (iii) visits; etc. In  the event of change in this address due to relocation or any other reason,  customers may intimate the new address for correspondence to the RRB/StCB/CCB  within two weeks of such a change.
3. RRBs and StCBs/CCBs may revise their KYC  policy in the light of the above instructions and ensure strict adherence to  the same.
4. The Principal Officer may  acknowledge receipt of this circular to our Regional Office concerned.
Yours faithfully,
(A. Udgata)
Principal Chief General Manager
