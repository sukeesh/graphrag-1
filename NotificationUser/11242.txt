Dear Sir,
Comprehensive Guidelines on Derivatives: Modifications
Please refer to para 8.3 of the
circular DBOD No.BP.BC.44/21.04.157/2011-12 dated November 2, 2011
, in terms of which ‘user suitability and appropriateness’ are applicable to all generic and structured derivative products except forex forward contracts.
2. The instructions have been reviewed, and it has now been decided that stand-alone plain vanilla forex options (without attached structures) purchased by clients will be exempt from the ‘user suitability and appropriateness’ norms, and the regulatory requirements will be at par with forex forward contracts.
Yours faithfully
