Please refer to
paragraph 13 of the Statement on Development and Regulatory Policies

circular RPCD.PLFS.BC.No 85/05.04.02/2009-10 dated June 18, 2010
on the captioned subject.
3. Keeping in view the overall inflation and rise in agriculture input cost over the years since 2010, it has been decided to raise the limit for collateral free agricultural loans from the existing level of ₹1 lakh to ₹1.6 lakh. Accordingly, banks may waive margin requirements for agricultural loans upto ₹1.6 lakh.

5. Please acknowledge receipt.
Yours faithfully,
