Dear Madam / Sir,

Please refer to paragraph 1 of
Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies
regarding revised framework for Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) for Debit Card Transactions announced in the Fifth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2017-18 by the Reserve Bank of India.

, which was revised vide

3. Based on consultations with stakeholders on the “Draft Circular - Rationalisation of Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) for Debit Card Transactions”, as also taking into account the twin objectives of promoting debit card acceptance by a wider set of merchants, especially small merchants, and ensuring sustainability of the business for the entities involved, it has been decided to rationalise the MDR for debit cards based on the following criteria:
Categorisation of merchants on the basis of turnover.
Adoption of a differentiated MDR for QR-code based transactions.
Specifying a ceiling on the maximum permissible MDR for both ‘card present’ and ‘card not present’ transactions.
4. Accordingly, the maximum MDR for debit card transactions shall be as under:
Sr. No
Merchant Category
Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) for debit card transactions
(as a % of transaction value)
Physical POS infrastructure including online card transactions
QR code-based card acceptance infrastructure
1.
Small merchants
(with turnover upto ₹ 20 lakh during the previous financial year)
Not exceeding 0.40%
(MDR cap of ₹ 200 per transaction)
Not exceeding 0.30%
(MDR cap of ₹ 200 per transaction)
2.
Other merchants
(with turnover above ₹ 20 lakh during the previous financial year)
Not exceeding 0.90%
(MDR cap of ₹ 1000 per transaction)
Not exceeding 0.80%

5. A reference is invited to our

Further, banks shall ensure that the MDR levied on the merchant shall not exceed the cap rates as prescribed above, irrespective of the entity which is deploying the card acceptance infrastructure at the merchant location.
6. Banks are also advised to ensure that merchants on-boarded by them do not pass on MDR charges to customers while accepting payments through debit cards.
7. The above instructions shall be effective from
January 1, 2018
. These instructions are subject to review.
8. The directive is issued under Section 10(2) read with Section 18 of Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007, (Act 51 of 2007).
