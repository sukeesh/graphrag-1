Please refer to DBR Circular DBOD.No.Prog.BC.124/C.283(A)-84 dated December 19, 1984, wherein Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India were required to provide every year latest set of specimen signatures of senior officials of RBI authorized to issue letters of introduction to inspecting officers to the Head/ Controlling offices of banks/FIs within their jurisdiction.
2. Consequent to the introduction of Risk Based Supervision framework, Senior Supervisory Managers (SSMs) have been acting as a single and focal point of contact for all communications/interfaces between the bank and RBI. Banks/FIs are being advised of the appointment of SSMs, by Department of Banking Supervision, Central Office, RBI.
3. In view of the above, it has been decided to discontinue the practice as mentioned in the aforesaid circular dated December 19, 1984.
