Other    Conditions
Licence    applications will be considered and licences given by the Department of    Industrial Policy & Promotion, Ministry of Commerce & Industry, in    consultation with Ministry of Defence and Ministry of External Affairs.
The applicant company seeking permission of the    Government for FDI up to 49% should be an Indian company owned and controlled    by resident Indian citizens.
The management of the applicant company should be in    Indian hands with majority    representation on the Board as well as the Chief Executives of the company/partnership firm being resident Indians.
Chief    Security Officer (CSO) of the investee/ joint venture company should be resident Indian citizen.
Full particulars    of the Directors and the Chief Executives should be furnished along with the applications.
The Government reserves the right to verify the    antecedents of the foreign collaborators and    domestic promoters including their financial standing and credentials in the world market. Preference would be    given to original equipment    manufacturers or design establishments and companies having a good track record of past supplies to Armed Forces,    Space and Atomic energy sections and    having an established R & D base.
There    would be no minimum capitalization for the FDI. A proper assessment, however, needs to be done by the management of the    applicant company depending upon the    product and the technology. The licensing authority would satisfy itself about the adequacy of the net worth of    the non-resident investor taking into    account the category of weapons and equipment that are proposed to be manufactured.
The Ministry of Defence is not in a position to give    purchase guarantee for products to be    manufactured. However, the planned acquisition programme for such equipment and overall requirements would be    made available to the extent possible.
The capacity norms for production will be provided in    the licence based on the application as well as the recommendations of the    Ministry of Defence, which will look into existing capacities of similar and    allied products.
Investee/joint venture company should be structured to    be self-sufficient in areas of product design and development. The    investee/joint venture company along with manufacturing facility, should also    have maintenance and life cycle support facility of the product being    manufactured in India.
Import of equipment for pre-production activity    including development of prototype by the applicant company would be    permitted.
Adequate    safety and security procedures would need to be put in place by the licensee    once the licence is granted and production commences. These would be subject    to verification by authorized Government agencies.
The standards and testing procedures for equipment to be    produced under licence from foreign collaborators or from indigenous R &    D will have to be provided by the licensee to the Government nominated    quality assurance agency under appropriate confidentiality clause. The    nominated quality assurance agency would inspect the finished product and    would conduct surveillance and audit of the Quality Assurance Procedures of    the licensee. Self-certification would be permitted by the Ministry of    Defence on case to case basis, which may involve either individual items, or    group of items manufactured by the licensee. Such permission would be for a    fixed period and subject to renewals.
Purchase preference and price preference may be given to    the Public Sector organizations as per guidelines of the Department of Public    Enterprises.
Arms and    ammunition produced by the private manufacturers will be primarily sold to    the Ministry of Defence. These items may also be sold to other Government    entities under the control of the Ministry of Home Affairs and State    Governments with the prior approval of the Ministry of Defence. No such item    should be sold within the country to any other person or entity. The export    of manufactured items would be subject to policy and guidelines as applicable    to Ordnance Factories and Defence Public Sector Undertakings. Non-lethal    items would be permitted for sale to persons/entities other than the Central    or State Governments with the prior approval of the Ministry of Defence.    Licensee would also need to institute a verifiable system of removal of all    goods out of their factories. Violation of these provisions may lead to    cancellation of the licence.
All applications seeking permission of the    Government for FDI in defence   would    be made to the Secretariat of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) in    the Department of Economic Affairs.
Applications for    FDI up to 49% will follow the existing procedure with proposals  involving inflows in excess of Rs. 1200    crore being approved by Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).
Based on the recommendation of the Ministry of Defence    and FIPB, approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) will be sought    by the Ministry of Defence in respect of cases seeking permission of the    Government for FDI beyond 49% which are likely to result in access to modern    and `state-of-art' technology in the country.
Proposals for FDI beyond 49% with proposed inflow    in excess of Rs. 1200 crores, which are to be approved by CCS will not    require further approval of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA).
Government decision on applications for FDI in    defence industry sector will be normally communicated within a time frame of    10 weeks from the date of acknowledgement.
For the proposal seeking Government approval for    foreign investment beyond 49% applicant should be Indian company/foreign    investor. Further condition at para (iii) above will not apply on such    proposals.
Yours faithfully,
(C.D. Srinivasan)
