Madam/Dear Sir:
Interest Subvention Scheme for Short Term Crop Loans during the year 2017-18
Please refer to our circular
FIDD CO.FSD.BC.No.29/05.02.001/2016-17 dated May 25, 2017
conveying continuation of Interest Subvention Scheme on the interim basis. In this regard, it is advised that Government of India has approved the implementation of the Interest Subvention Scheme for the year 2017-18 for short term crop loans up to ₹ 3.00 lakhs with the following stipulations:
In order to provide short-term crop loans upto ₹ 3 lakh to farmers at an interest rate of 7% p.a. during the year 2017-18, it has been decided to offer interest subvention of 2% per annum to lending institutions viz. Public Sector Banks (PSBs), Private Sector Commercial Banks (in respect of loans given by their rural and semi-urban branches only) on use of their own resources. This interest subvention of 2% will be calculated on the crop loan amount from the date of its disbursement/ drawal up to the date of actual repayment of the crop loan by the farmer or up to the due date of the loan fixed by the banks whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year.
To provide an additional interest subvention of 3% per annum to such of those farmers repaying in time i.e. from the date of disbursement of the crop loan upto the actual date of repayment by farmers or upto the due date fixed by the banks for repayment of crop loan, whichever is earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year from the date of disbursement. This also implies that the farmers paying promptly as above would get short term crop loans @ 4% per annum during the year 2017-18.
In order to discourage distress sale and to encourage them to store their produce in warehouses, the benefit of interest subvention will be available to
small and marginal farmers
having Kisan Credit Card for a further period of upto six months post the harvest of the crop at the same rate as available to crop loan against negotiable warehouse receipts issued on the produce stored in warehouses accredited with Warehousing Development Regulatory Authority (WDRA).
To provide relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, an interest subvention of 2 percent per annum will be made available to banks for the first year on the restructured loan amount. Such restructured loans will attract normal rate of interest from the second year onwards.
To avoid multiple loaning and to ensure that only genuine farmers avail concessional crop loan through the mechanism of gold loans, the lending institutions may conduct due diligence and ensure proper documentation including recording of land details even when the farmer avails gold loans for such purposes.
To ensure hassle-free benefits to farmers under Interest Subvention Scheme, the banks are advised to make Aadhar linkage mandatory for availing short-term crop loans in 2017-18.
