1. Introduction
Reserve Bank of India  has been regulating the financial activities of the Non-Banking Financial  Companies under the provisions of
Chapter III B
of the Reserve Bank of  India Act, 1934. With the amendment of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 in  January 1997, in terms of
Section 45 IA
of the said Act, all Non-Banking  Financial Companies have to be mandatorily registered with the Reserve Bank of  India.
1.1 Terminology
'NBFCs'  means the Non-Banking Financial Companies registered with Department of  Non-Banking Supervision of Reserve Bank of India.
Residuary  Non-Banking Companies (RNBCs) are the companies classified and registered with  Department of Non-Banking Supervision of Reserve Bank of India as such.
'Current  investments' means the investments classified in the balance sheet of the  borrower as 'current assets' and are intended to be held for less than one  year.
'Long  term investments' means all types of investments other than that classified as  'current assets'.
'Unsecured loans' means the loans not secured by  any tangible asset.
1.2 Background
The credit related  matters of banks have been progressively deregulated by Reserve Bank of India.  Consistent with the policy of bestowing greater operational freedom to banks in  the matter of credit dispensation and in the context of mandatory registration  of NBFCs with the Reserve Bank, most of the aspects relating to financing of  NBFCs by banks have also been deregulated. However, in view of the  sensitivities attached to financing of certain types of activities undertaken  by NBFCs, restrictions on financing of such activities continue to be in force.
2.  Bank Finance to NBFCs registered with RBI
2.1 The ceiling on  bank credit linked to Net Owned Fund (NOF) of NBFCs has been withdrawn in  respect of all NBFCs which are statutorily registered with RBI and are engaged  in principal business of asset financing, loan, factoring and investment  activities. Accordingly, banks may extend need based working capital facilities  as well as term loans to all NBFCs registered with RBI and engaged in  infrastructure financing, equipment leasing, hire-purchase, loan, factoring and  investment activities.
2.2 In the light of  the experience gained by NBFCs in financing second hand assets, banks may also  extend finance to NBFCs against second hand assets financed by them.
2.3 Banks may  formulate suitable loan policy with the approval of their Boards of Directors  within the prudential guidelines and exposure norms prescribed by the Reserve  Bank to extend various kinds of credit facilities to NBFCs subject to the  condition that the activities indicated in paragraphs 5 and 6 are not financed  by them.
3. Bank  Finance to NBFCs not requiring Registration
1
In respect of NBFCs  which do not require to be registered with RBI, viz. i) Insurance Companies  registered under
Section 3
of the Insurance Act, 1938; ii) Nidhi  Companies notified under Section 620A of the Companies Act, 1956; iii) Chit  Fund Companies carrying on Chit Fund business as their principal business as  per Explanation to Clause (vii) of
Section 45-I(bb)
of the Reserve Bank  of India Act, 1934; iv) Stock Broking Companies / Merchant Banking Companies  registered under Section 12 of the Securities & Exchange Board of India  Act; and v) Housing Finance Companies being regulated by the National Housing  Bank (NHB) which have been exempted from the requirement of registration by  RBI, banks may take their credit decisions on the basis of usual factors like the  purpose of credit, nature and quality of underlying assets, repayment capacity  of borrowers as also risk perception, etc.
4. Bank Finance to Residuary Non-Banking  Companies (RNBCs)
4.1
Residuary  Non-Banking Companies (RNBCs) are also required to be mandatorily registered  with Reserve Bank of India. In respect of such companies registered with RBI,  bank finance would be restricted to the extent of their Net Owned Fund (NOF).
4.2 Net Owned  Fund (NOF)
4.2.1. Banks should  follow the definition of NOF as given in the explanation to
Section 45-IA
of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, i.e.,
I. Net Owned Fund means
(a) the aggregate of  the paid-up equity capital and free reserves as disclosed in the latest balance  sheet of the company after deducting there from -
accumulated  balance of loss;
deferred  revenue expenditure; and
other intangible assets; and
(b) further reduced by  the amounts representing

all other Non-Banking Financial Companies; and
(2) the book value of  debentures, bonds, outstanding loans and advances (including hire purchase and  lease finance) made to, and deposits with
subsidiaries  of such company; and
companies in the same group,
to the extent such  amount exceeds ten percent of (a) above.
II. "Subsidiaries"  and "Companies in the same group" shall have the same meanings  assigned to them in the Companies Act, 1956 (1of 1956).
5. Activities not Eligible for Bank Credit
5.1
The following activities undertaken by  NBFCs, are not eligible for bank credit:
(i) Bills discounted  / rediscounted by NBFCs, except for rediscounting of bills discounted by NBFCs  arising from sale of -
commercial vehicles  (including light commercial vehicles),and
two wheeler and three wheeler vehicles, subject  to the following conditions :
the  bills should have been drawn by the manufacturer on dealers only;
the  bills should represent genuine sale transactions as may be ascertained from the  chassis / engine number; and

(v) Finance to NBFCs  for further lending to individuals for subscribing to Initial Public Offerings  (IPOs) and for purchase of shares from secondary market.
5.2 Leased and  Sub-Leased Assets
As banks can extend  financial assistance to equipment leasing companies, they should not enter into  lease agreements departmentally with such companies as well as other  Non-Banking Financial Companies engaged in equipment leasing.
6. Bank Finance to Factoring Companies
6.1 In  terms of the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011, which regulates factoring  companies and, inter-alia, defines the terms ‘factor, factoring business,  principal business, assignment’, etc., the Reserve Bank has been given powers  to stipulate conditions for ‘principal business’ in terms of assets and gross  income as also powers to give directions and collect information from factors.
6.2 Accordingly,  the Reserve Bank has introduced a new category of NBFCs viz.; ‘Non-Banking  Financial Company – Factors’ and has issued a Notification  DNBS.PD.No.247/CGM(US)-2012 dated July 23, 2012 in this regard. Paragraph 6 (i)  of the above Notification has prescribed ‘Principal Business’ of such an NBFC  and it states that “An NBFC-Factor shall ensure that its financial assets in the factoring  business constitute at least 75 percent of its total assets and its income  derived from factoring business is not less than 75 percent of its gross  income.”
6.3 In  view of the above, the criteria regarding asset and income of factoring  companies eligible for bank finance have been reviewed. Accordingly,  notwithstanding the restrictions mentioned at Paragraph 5.1(i) and 5.1 (iv)  above,  banks can henceforth extend financial assistance to support the factoring  business of Factoring Companies, which comply with the following criteria:
(a)  The companies qualify as factoring companies and carry out their business under  the provisions of the Factoring Regulation Act, 2011 and Notifications issued  by the Reserve Bank in this regard from time to time.
(b)  They derive at least 75 per cent of their income from factoring activity.
(c)  The receivables purchased / financed, irrespective of whether on 'with  recourse' or 'without recourse' basis, form at least 75 per cent of the assets  of the Factoring Company.
(d)  The assets / income referred to above would not include the assets / income  relating to any bill discounting facility extended by the Factoring Company.
(e) The financial assistance extended by the Factoring Companies is secured  by hypothecation or assignment of receivables in their favour.
7. Other Prohibitions on Bank Finance to  NBFCs
7.1 Bridge  loans / interim finance
Banks should not grant  bridge loans of any nature, or interim finance against capital / debenture  issues and / or in the form of loans of a bridging nature pending raising of  long-term funds from the market by way of capital, deposits, etc. to all  categories of Non-Banking Financial Companies and also Residuary Non- Banking  Companies (RNBCs). Banks should strictly follow these instructions and ensure  that these are not circumvented in any manner whatsoever by purport and / or  intent by sanction of credit under a different nomenclature like unsecured  negotiable notes, floating rate interest bonds, etc., as also short-term loans,  the repayment of which is proposed / expected to be made out of funds to be or  likely to be mobilised from external / other sources and not out of the surplus  generated by the use of the asset(s).
7.2 Advances  against collateral security of shares to NBFCs
Shares and debentures  cannot be accepted as collateral securities for secured loans granted to NBFCs  borrowers for any purpose.
7.3 Restriction on guarantees for placement  of funds with NBFCs
Banks should not  execute guarantees covering inter-company deposits / loans thereby guaranteeing  refund of deposits / loans accepted by NBFCs / firms from other NBFCs / firms.  The restriction would cover all types of deposits / loans irrespective of their  source, including deposits / loans received by NBFCs from trusts and  other institutions. Guarantees should not be issued for the purpose of  indirectly enabling the placement of deposits with NBFCs.
8. Prudential  ceilings for exposure of banks to NBFCs
8.1
The exposure (both lending and  investment, including off balance sheet  exposures)  of a bank to a single NBFC / NBFC-AFC (Asset Financing Companies), which is not  predominantly engaged in lending against collateral of gold jewellery, should  not exceed 10% / 15% respectively, of the bank's capital funds as per its last  audited balance sheet. Banks may, however, assume exposures on such a single  NBFC / NBFC-AFC up to 15% / 20% respectively, of their capital funds provided  the exposure in excess of 10% / 15% respectively, is on account of funds  on-lent by the NBFC / NBFC-AFC to the infrastructure sector. Further, exposure  of a bank to the NBFCs-IFCs (Infrastructure Finance Companies) should not  exceed 15 per cent of its capital funds as per its last audited balance sheet,  with a provision to increase it to 20 per cent if the same is on account of  funds on-lent by the IFCs to the infrastructure sector.
8.2
Banks may also consider fixing internal  limits for their aggregate exposure to all NBFCs put together.
8.3
The  exposure (both lending and investment, including off balance sheet exposures) of  a bank to a single NBFC which is predominantly engaged in lending against collateral of gold  jewellery (i.e. such loans comprising  50 per cent or more of their financial assets), should  not exceed 7.5 per cent of banks’ capital funds. However, this exposure ceiling  may go up by 5 per cent,
i.e.,
up to 12.5 per cent of banks’ capital  funds if the additional exposure is on account of funds on-lent by such NBFCs  to the infrastructure sector. Banks which were having exposure to such NBFCs in  excess of the above regulatory ceiling as on May 18, 2012 were required to  reduce their exposure within the prescribed limit at the earliest, but not  later than November 17, 2012.
8.4
Banks should have an internal sub-limit on their aggregate  exposures to all NBFCs, having gold  loans to the extent of 50 per cent or more of their total financial assets,  taken together. This sub-limit should be within the internal limit fixed by the  banks for their aggregate exposure to all NBFCs put together as prescribed in  paragraph 8.2 above.
8.5
Infusion of capital funds after the  published balance sheet date may also be taken into account for the purpose of  computing exposure ceiling. Banks should obtain an external auditor's  certificate on completion of the augmentation of capital and submit the same to  the Reserve Bank of India (Department of Banking Supervision) before reckoning the  additions to capital funds.
9. Restrictions  regarding investments made by banks in securities / instruments issued by NBFCs
9.1
Banks should not invest in Zero Coupon  Bonds ( ZCBs) issued by NBFCs unless the issuer NBFC builds up sinking fund for  all accrued interest and keeps it invested in liquid investments / securities  (Government bonds).
9.2
Banks are permitted to invest in  Non-Convertible Debentures (NCDs) with original or initial maturity up to one  year issued by NBFCs. However, while investing in such instruments banks should  be guided by the extant prudential guidelines in force, ensure that the issuer  has disclosed the purpose for which the NCDs are being issued in the disclosure  document and such purposes are eligible for bank finance in terms of  instructions given in the preceding paragraphs.
