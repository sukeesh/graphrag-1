Notification No.  FEMA/25/RB-2000 dated May 3, 2000

2. Under the extant regulations, the  facility of cancellation and rebooking is not permitted for forward contracts,  involving Rupee as one of the currencies, booked by residents to hedge current  and capital account transactions. However, exporters are allowed to  cancel and rebook forward contracts to the extent of 50 per cent of the  contracts booked in a financial year for hedging their contracted export  exposures and importers are allowed to cancel and rebook forward contracts to  the extent of 25 percent of the contracts booked in a financial year for  hedging their contracted import exposures.
3. On a review of the evolving market  conditions and with a view to providing operational flexibility in respect of  current and capital account transactions, it has been decided to allow, in case  of contracted exposures, forward contracts in respect of all current account  transactions as well as capital account transactions with a residual maturity  of one year or less to be freely cancelled and rebooked. As far as the exposure  of the FIIs/QFIs/other portfolio investors is concerned, forward contracts booked  by these investors, once cancelled, can be rebooked up to the extent of 10 per  cent of the value of the contracts cancelled. The forward contracts booked by  these investors may, however, be rolled over on or before maturity.
4. AD Category-I banks may bring the  contents of this circular to the notice of their constituents and customers.
5. The directions contained in this  circular have been issued under Sections 10(4) and 11(1) of the Foreign  Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999) and are without prejudice to  permissions/ approvals, if any, required under any other law.
Yours faithfully,
(CD  Srinivasan)
