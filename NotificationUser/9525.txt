Dear Sir/Madam
Membership of Credit  Information Companies (CICs) by Co-operative Banks
Please refer to our
circulars  UBD.BPD (PCB) Cir.No.25/09.11.200/2009-10 dated December 03, 2009
and
RPCD.CO.RF.BC.No.44/07.40.06/2009-10  dated December 01, 2009
advising  co-operative banks to take membership of  at least one CIC and provide credit data (positive as well as negative) in the  prescribed format to CIC.
2. Presently, four  CICs, viz. Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited, Equifax Credit  Information Services Private Limited, Experian Credit Information Company of  India Private Limited and CRIF High Mark Credit Information Services Private  Limited have been granted Certificate of Registration by RBI. In terms of  Section 15 of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005 (CICRA),  every Credit Institution shall become member of at least one CIC. Further,  Section 17 of CICRA stipulates that a CIC may seek and obtain credit  information from its members (Credit Institution / CIC) only. As a result, when  a Specified User, as defined in CICRA and Credit Information Companies  Regulations, 2006, obtains credit information on a particular borrower/client  from a CIC, it gets only such information that has been provided to the CIC by  its members. This does not include credit history related to those non-member  Credit Institutions with which the borrower/client has/had a current or a past  exposure. To overcome this problem of 
      incomplete/inaccurate credit  information, pros and cons of certain possible alternatives have been discussed  in the Report of the Committee to Recommend Data Format for  Furnishing of Credit Information to Credit Information Companies (Chairman:  Shri Aditya Puri) constituted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The Report of  the Committee can be accessed on the following URL:

.  These alternatives along with suggestions/comments obtained from IBA and  the CICs have been examined by RBI. It has been decided that the best option  would be to mandate all Credit Institutions to become members of all CICs and  moderate the membership and annual fees suitably. These instructions would be  reviewed in due course.
3. Accordingly all  Co-operative banks are advised to comply with the directive issued by  Department of Banking Regulation, Central Office vide
DBR.No.CID.BC.59/20.16.056/2014-15 dated January 15, 2015
and become member of all CICs and submit data (including  historical data) to them.
Yours faithfully
