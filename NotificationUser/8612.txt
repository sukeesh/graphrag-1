Dear Sir/Madam,
Periodicity of  Payment of Interest on Rupee Savings/Term Deposits
Please refer to paragraph 23 of the Second  Quarter Review of Monetary Policy 2013-14 announced on October 29, 2013 (
extract  enclosed
) on periodicity of payment of interest on savings and term  deposits.
2. In this connection, a reference is also  invited to paragraph 2 (ii) of our circular  DBOD.No.Dir.BC.46/13.03.00/2000-2001 dated November 4, 2000 on 'Interest Rates  on Rupee Deposits held in Domestic, Ordinary Non-Resident (NRO), Non-Resident  Special Rupee (NRSR) and Non-Resident (External) (NRE) Accounts' whereby Regional  Rural Banks (RRBs) were advised to pay interest on savings and term deposits at  quarterly or longer rests. As RRBs are functioning on core banking platform, it  has been decided to review the above instructions. Accordingly, RRBs will now  have the option to pay interest on Rupee savings and term deposits at intervals  shorter than quarterly intervals.
3. The above revised instructions are  applicable to domestic Rupee deposits including Ordinary Non-Resident (NRO) and  Non-Resident (External) (NRE) savings and term deposits. As regard FCNR(B)  deposits, the existing guidelines issued in this regard will remain unchanged.
4.  All other instructions in this regard, as amended from time to time, will  remain unchanged.
Yours faithfully,
(A.Udgata)
