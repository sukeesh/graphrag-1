Madam/Sir,
Review of Instructions on Bulk Deposits for Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs)
Please refer to Para 3 (a) (i) of
Master Direction - Reserve Bank of India (Co-operative Banks - Interest Rate on Deposits) Directions, 2016 dated May 12, 2016
, in terms of which “Bulk Deposit” means single Rupee term deposits of Rupees fifteen lakh and above.
2. On a review, it has been decided to enhance the bulk deposit limit for Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, in Tier 3 and 4, to Rupees one crore and above. Accordingly, “Bulk Deposit” for Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks would now mean:
Single Rupee term deposits of Rupees one crore and above for Scheduled UCBs categorised as Tier 3 and 4 UCBs under the revised regulatory framework.
Single Rupee term deposits of Rupees fifteen lakh and above for all other UCBs (i.e., other than Scheduled UCBs in Tier 3 and 4).
The relevant sections of the Master Direction as amended are indicated in the
Annex
.
3. All other instructions in this regard shall remain unchanged.
Yours faithfully,
(Sunil T. S. Nair)
