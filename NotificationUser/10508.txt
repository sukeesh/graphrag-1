5. Lien marking
As the bonds are government securities, lien marking, etc. will be as per the extant legal provisions of Government Securities Act, 2006 and rules framed there under.

Scheduled commercial banks may engage NBFCs, NSC agents and others to collect application forms on their behalf. Banks may enter into arrangements or tie-ups with such entities. Commission for distribution shall be paid at the rate of rupee one per hundred of the total subscription received by the receiving offices on the applications received and receiving offices shall share at least 50% of the commission so received with the agents or sub-agents for the business procured through them.
7. Processing through RBI’s e-kuber system
Sovereign Gold Bonds will be available for subscription at the branches of scheduled commercial banks and designated post offices through RBI’s e-kuber system. The e-kuber system can be accessed either through Infinet or Internet. The receiving offices need to enter the data or carry out bulk upload for the subscriptions received by them. They may ensure accuracy of entry of data to prevent occurrence of any inadvertent errors. An immediate confirmation will be provided to them for receipt of application. In addition, a confirmation scroll will be provided for file uploads to enable the receiving offices to update their database. On the date of allotment, i.e., August 5, 2016, Holding Certificates will be generated for all the subscriptions. The receiving offices can download the same and take printouts. The Holding Certificates will also be sent through e-mail to the investors who have provided their email address. For the investors who have specified their demat account details, the securities will be credited in their demat accounts on the allotment date.

Holding Certificate needs to be printed in colour on A4 size 100 GSM paper.
9. Servicing and follow up
Receiving offices, i.e., branches of the scheduled commercial banks and designated post offices will “own” the customer and provide necessary services with regards to this bond e.g. update contact details, receive requests for premature encashment, etc. Receiving offices will be required to preserve applications till the bonds are matured and are repaid.
