Revised Regulatory Framework - Categorization of Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) for Regulatory Purposes
Given the heterogeneity in the cooperative sector, a tiered regulatory framework is required to balance the spirit of mutuality and co-operation more prevalent in banks of smaller sizes and those with limited area of operation vis-à-vis the growth ambitions of the large-sized UCBs to spread their area of operation and undertake more complex business activities.
2. The Reserve Bank of India had constituted the
Expert Committee on Urban Co-operative Banks
to examine the issues in urban cooperative banking sector and to review regulatory/ supervisory approach for strengthening the sector. Based on the recommendations of the Expert Committee, RBI had released the
Revised Regulatory Framework for Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) on July 19, 2022
.
3. Accordingly, it has been decided to adopt a four-tiered regulatory framework, as against the existing two-tiered framework, for categorization of UCBs. Going forward, this categorization may be used for differentiated regulatory prescriptions aimed at strengthening the financial soundness of the UCBs.
4. The categorization of UCBs, based on their deposit size, is enclosed in
Annex
.
