To,
All Authorised Persons
Madam/ Sir,
Master Direction – Reporting under Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999
Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA) is administered through the authorised persons and is based on the declarations and averments made to them by persons while undertaking the transactions. The Reserve Bank, therefore, has prescribed various reports and forms under FEMA to be submitted by/ through Authorised Persons/ Authorised Dealer Category – I Banks/ Authorised Banks. Accurate compilations and timely submission of these reports are of critical importance as they not only act as a supervisory tool but also help in fine-tuning the policies relating to foreign exchange transactions regulated under FEMA.
2. The various reports/ forms required to be submitted under FEMA are consolidated under this Master Direction.
3. The
Master Direction
will be updated from time to time as and when fresh instructions are issued.
Yours faithfully,
(Dr. Aditya Gaiha)
Chief General Manager-in-Charge
