Madam/Dear Sir,
Claims Received from the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd (NCGTC) - Classification for the Purpose of Maintenance of Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)/Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR)
Please refer to para 9 (Liabilities not to be included for NDTL computation) of
Master Direction on CRR/SLR – 2021 dated July 20, 2021, as amended on April 06, 2022
.
2. In this connection, it has been decided that the amounts received by a bank from the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd towards claims in respect of guarantees invoked and held by them pending adjustment of the same towards the relative advances, need not be treated as outside liabilities for the purpose of computation of NDTL for CRR and SLR.
3. Accordingly, para 9 of the Master Direction on CRR/SLR – 2021 will henceforth include “Amount received by the eligible banks from National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Limited (NCGTC) by invoking the guarantee towards claims and pending adjustments thereof”.
Yours faithfully
