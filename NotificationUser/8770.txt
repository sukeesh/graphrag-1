, Regional  Rural Banks (RRBs) and State and Central Cooperative Banks (StCBs/CCBs) were  advised that, while opening accounts based on Aadhaar, if the address provided  by the account holder is the same as that on Aadhaar letter, it may be accepted  as a proof of both identity and address.
2. In this connection, a reference may be made to our
circular RPCD.RRB. RCB.AML.BC.No.32/07.51.018/2013-14  dated September 10, 2013
, wherein, a decision to accept e-KYC service as a  valid process for KYC verification under Prevention of Money Laundering (Maintenance  of Records) Rules, 2005 was advised. It was further advised that the  information containing demographic details and photographs made available from  UIDAI as a result of e-KYC process (which is in an electronic form and  accessible so as to be usable for a subsequent reference) may be treated as an  ‘Officially Valid Document’ under PML Rules.
3. In this regard, it is clarified that, RRBs and StCBs/CCBs may accept  e-Aadhaar downloaded from UIDAI website as an officially valid document subject  to the following:

If  the prospective customer carries a copy of the e-Aadhaar downloaded elsewhere,  the bank may print the prospective customer’s e-Aadhaar letter in the bank  directly from the UIDAI portal; or adopt e-KYC procedure as mentioned in the  circular referred in paragraph 2 above, or confirm identity and address of the  resident through simple authentication service of UIDAI.
4. Physical Aadhaar card/letter  issued by UIDAI containing details of name, address and Aadhaar number received  through post and e-KYC process mentioned in the circular referred in paragraph  2 above would continue to be accepted as an ‘Officially Valid Document’.
5. RRBs and StCBs/CCBs may revise  their KYC policy in the light of the above instructions and ensure strict  adherence to the same.
Yours  faithfully,
