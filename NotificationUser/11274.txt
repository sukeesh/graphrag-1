4. Achievement of Priority Sector targets
Achievement of priority sector targets will be taken into account while granting regulatory clearances / approvals for various purposes. With effect from April 1, 2018, achievement of priority sector targets will be included as a criterion for classifying a UCB as Financially Sound and Well Managed (FSWM), in addition to the criteria specified in our
circulars UBD.CO.LS.(PCB).Cir.No.20/07.01.000/2014-15

From the financial year 2019-20 onwards, the achievement at the end of the financial year will be arrived at based on the average of priority sector target / sub-target achievement as at the end of each quarter.
