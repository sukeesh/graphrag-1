All NBFCs (excluding Primary Dealers)
Dear Sirs,
Requirement for obtaining prior approval of RBI in cases of acquisition/ transfer of control of NBFCs
Under Section 45 IA (4)(c) of the RBI Act, 1934, a certificate of Registration can only be given to a company if the Bank is satisfied, inter alia, that the general character of the management or the proposed management of the non-banking financial company shall not be prejudicial to the public interest or the interests of its depositors.
2. In this connection attention is drawn to
DNBS (PD) C.C.No.160/ 03.10.001/2009-10 dated September 17, 2009
requiring prior approval of the Reserve Bank in cases of acquisition/ transfer of control of NBFCs accepting deposits. In supersession of those instructions, and to enable RBI to ensure that the 'fit and proper' character of the management of NBFCs, both deposit accepting and non-deposit accepting, is continuously maintained, it has been decided as under:
The prior written permission of the Reserve Bank of India shall be required for –
(i) any takeover or acquisition of control of an NBFC, whether by acquisition of shares or otherwise;
(ii) any merger/amalgamation of an NBFC with another entity or any merger/amalgamation of an entity with an NBFC that would give the acquirer / another entity control of the NBFC;
(iii) any merger/amalgamation of an NBFC with another entity or any merger/amalgamation of an entity with an NBFC which would result in acquisition/transfer of shareholding in excess of 10 percent of the paid up capital of the NBFC.
(iv) Prior written approval of the Reserve Bank would also be required before approaching the Court or Tribunal under Section 391-394 of the Companies Act, 1956 or Section 230-233 of Companies Act, 2013 seeking order for mergers or amalgamations with other companies or NBFCs.
3. Applications in this regard may be submitted to the Regional Office of the Department of Non-Banking Supervision in whose jurisdiction the Registered Office of the Company is located.
4.
Notification No.DNBS(PD) 275/GM(AM)/2013-14 dated May 26, 2014
, issued in this regard by the Reserve Bank in exercise of powers under Sections 45K and 45L of the RBI Act, 1934 is enclosed for meticulous compliance.
5. Any transfer of shares in violation of the notification would result in adverse regulatory action including cancellation of Certificate of Registration (CoR).
Yours faithfully,
