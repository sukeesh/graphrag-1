Madam / Sir,
Basel III Capital Regulations – Capital Requirements  for Credit Valuation Adjustment Risk on OTC Derivatives and for Banks’  Exposures to Central Counterparties
Please refer to
circular  DBOD.No.BP.BC.88/21.06.201/2012-13 dated March 28, 2013
on ‘Implementation of  Basel III Capital Regulations in India - Clarifications’ wherein banks were  advised,
inter alia,
that the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk  capital charge on OTC derivatives would become effective from January 1, 2014.  This was done keeping in view the introduction of mandatory inter-bank forex  forward guaranteed settlement through a central counterparty i.e. Clearing  Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL). As this process would take some time, it has  been decided to implement the CVA risk capital charge  on OTC derivatives from April 1, 2014, instead of January 1, 2014.
2. As  advised vide
circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.28  /21.06.201/2013-14 dated July 2, 2013
, guidelines  on Capital Requirements for Banks’ Exposures to Central Counterparties  (CCPs) will become effective from January 1, 2014.
Yours faithfully,
(Chandan Sinha)
