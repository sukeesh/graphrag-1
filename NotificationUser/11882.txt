Madam / Dear Sir,
Submission of regulatory returns - Extension of timelines
In order to mitigate the difficulties in timely submission of various regulatory returns, in view of disruptions on account of COVID-19 pandemic, it has been decided to extend the timelines for their submission.
2. Accordingly, all regulatory returns required to be submitted by the above entities to the Department of Regulation can be submitted with a delay of upto 30 days from the due date. The extension will be applicable to regulatory returns required to be submitted upto June 30, 2020. Further details are furnished in the
Annex
. Those entities that are in a position to submit the returns earlier may continue to do so.
3. It may be noted that no extension in timeline is permitted for submission of statutory returns i.e. returns prescribed under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, RBI Act, 1934 or any other Act (for instance, returns related to CRR/SLR).
4. Further, all communication to the Department of Regulation should be through corporate e-mail to the extent possible (i.e., without involving physical movement of papers). This arrangement shall continue till further notice.
Yours faithfully,
(Saurav Sinha)
Chief General Manager-in-Charge
