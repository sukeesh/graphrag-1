advising banks/financial institutions(FIs) to register the transactions relating to securitization and reconstruction of financial assets and those relating to mortgage by deposit of title deeds with CERSAI.
2. The Government of India has subsequently issued a Gazette Notification dated January 22, 2016 for filing of the following types of security interest on the CERSAI portal:
Particulars of creation, modification or satisfaction of security interest in immovable property by mortgage other than mortgage by deposit of title deeds.
Particulars of creation, modification or satisfaction of security interest in hypothecation of plant and machinery, stocks, debts including book debts or receivables, whether existing or future.
Particulars of creation, modification or satisfaction of security interest in intangible assets, being know how, patent, copyright, trademark, licence, franchise or any other business or commercial right of similar nature.
Particulars of creation, modification or satisfaction of security interest in any ‘under construction’ residential or commercial or a part thereof by an agreement or instrument other than mortgage.
3. CERSAI had started registration of the data in respect of paragraphs 2 (a) to (c) above, for the security interests created on or after January 22, 2016, w.e.f. May 25, 2016 for Scheduled Commercial Banks and w.e.f. July 1, 2016 for all other entities registered with them. Further, the registration of data in respect of paragraph 2(d) above has commenced since June 8, 2017 for all banks and FIs registered with CERSAI. Meanwhile, the banks/ FIs have also started registering the security interests created before January 22, 2016 (subsisting records). However, it is observed that the extent of registration on the CERSAI portal is very low, both for current and subsisting records.
4. Banks/FIs are therefore advised to complete filing the charges pertaining to subsisting transactions by March 31, 2019. Banks/FIs are also advised to file the charges relating to all current transactions with CERSAI on an ongoing basis.
Yours faithfully
