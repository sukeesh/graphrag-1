PRIOR APPROVAL FOR ACQUISITION
4. Procedure for prior approval
4.1 Any person who intends to make an acquisition which is likely to result in major shareholding in a banking company
4
, is required to seek previous approval of the Reserve Bank by submitting an application to the Reserve Bank.
4.2 On receipt of the application and declaration from the applicant, the Reserve Bank may seek comments from the banking company on the proposed acquisition.
4.3 On receipt of the reference from the Reserve Bank, without prejudice to the generality of the aspects to be considered, the board of directors (the board) of the banking company shall, based on the information provided as well as due diligence undertaken by the banking company, deliberate on the proposed acquisition, and assess the ‘fit and proper’ status of the person. The concerned banking company shall furnish its comments after considering all relevant aspects along with a copy of the relevant board resolution and information in
Form A1
specified in these directions to the Reserve Bank within 30 days. For this purpose, banking companies shall put in place a board-approved ‘fit and proper’ criteria for major shareholders, which shall consider, at a minimum, the illustrative ‘fit and proper’ criteria mentioned in the
Annex II
.
4.4 The Reserve Bank would undertake due diligence to assess the ‘fit and proper’ status of the applicant. The decision of the Reserve Bank to (a) accord or deny permission or (b) accord permission for acquisition of a lower quantum of aggregate holding than that has been applied for, shall be binding on the applicant and the concerned banking company. The Reserve Bank may impose such conditions on the applicant and the concerned banking company as deemed fit while according the permission.
4.5 Subsequent to such acquisition, if at any point in time the aggregate holding falls below five per cent, the person will be required to seek fresh approval from the Reserve bank if the person intends to again raise the aggregate holding to five percent or more of the paid-up share capital or total voting rights of the banking company (as per sub-section (1) of Section 12B of B R Act, 1949).

Financial Action Task Force (FATF) non-compliant jurisdictions

The existing major shareholders from such FATF non-compliant jurisdictions will, however, be allowed to continue with their investment, provided that there shall not be any further acquisition without prior approval of the Reserve Bank.

7
who have completed the approved acquisition;
those applicants for whom comments have been provided by the concerned banking company to the Reserve Bank for approval to have major shareholding; and
those applicants who have been approved by the Reserve Bank to have major shareholding but are yet to complete the approved acquisition
8
.
5.2 Further, a banking company shall:
put in place a mechanism to obtain information on a continuous basis on any changes in the information provided in Form A appended to the
Guidelines
or any other development which may have a bearing on the ‘fit and proper’ status of major shareholder / applicant;
examine any concern / information regarding the major shareholders / applicants that could render such persons not ‘fit and proper’ to continue as / become major shareholder and immediately furnish the report on the same to the Reserve Bank;
obtain, within one month of the close of financial year, a report on any changes in the information provided in Form A appended to the
Guidelines
from the major shareholder / applicant; and
make an assessment about the ‘fit and proper’ status of such person(s) in the light of information provided and its own investigations and forward the comments of its Board regarding the ‘fit and proper’ status of its major shareholders / applicants, to the Department of Regulation, Reserve Bank of India, not later than September 30 every year.
5.3 The banking companies shall put in place a mechanism to obtain information on any change in Significant Beneficial Owner or acquisition by a person to the extent of 10 per cent or more of paid-up equity share capital of the major shareholder. In seeking the information, banking companies shall also be guided by the information sought in Form A appended to the
Guidelines
. Based on the information so received, the concerned banking company shall conduct requisite due diligence to ascertain whether the major shareholder continues to be ‘fit and proper’. The banking company shall, within 30 days from receipt of information on such changes, submit a brief report, along with the board note and resolution to Department of Regulation, Reserve Bank of India.
6. Detecting violation of Section 12B (1) of the B R Act, 1949

9
who is covered by sub-section (3) of section 12B of the B R Act, 1949, and has not obtained prior approval of the Reserve Bank, can exercise voting rights only after obtaining the approval of Reserve Bank for major shareholding.
