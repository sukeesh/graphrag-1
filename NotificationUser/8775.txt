2. At  present Securitisation Companies/ Reconstruction Companies (SC/ RCs) in terms  of Section 7(2) of the SARFAESI Act, 2002, may acquire financial assets out of  funds raised from the Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs). However, in the  wake of recommendations of the Key Advisory Group (KAG) constituted by the  Government of India on the SC/RCs and provisions contained in the Framework for Revitalizing Distressed Assets in the Economy, dated January 30, 2014, it has been decided to allow SC/ RCs to utilize  a part of funds raised under a scheme from the QIBs for
restructuring of  financial assets
acquired under the relative scheme subject to following  conditions:
Securitisation  Companies or Reconstruction Companies (SC/ RCs) with acquired assets in excess  of Rs. 500 crore can float the fund under a scheme which envisages the  utilization of part of funds raised from QIBs in terms of Section 7(2) of the  SARFAESI Act, 2002, for restructuring of financial assets acquired out of such  funds.
The  extent of funds that shall be utilized for reconstruction purpose should not be  more than 25% of the funds raised under the scheme in terms of Section 7(2) of  the SARFAESI Act, 2002. The funds raised to be utilized for reconstruction  (within the ceiling of 25%) should be disclosed upfront in the scheme. Further,  the funds utilized for reconstruction purposes should be separately accounted  for.
Every Securitisation Company or Reconstruction  Company shall frame a policy, duly approved by the Board of Directors, laying  down the broad parameters for utilization of funds raised from QIBs under such  a scheme.
Yours  sincerely,
(N.S. Vishwanathan)
