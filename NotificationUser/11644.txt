Micro Enterprises
7.5 per cent of ANBC
Advances to Weaker Sections

The computation of priority sector targets/sub-targets achievement will be based on the total ANBC as on the corresponding date of the preceding year.
## Further, all Small Finance Banks are directed to ensure that the overall lending to non-corporate farmers does not fall below the system-wide average of the last three years achievement. The applicable system wide average for computing achievement under priority sector lending will be notified every year. For FY 2019-20, the applicable system wide average figure is 12.11 percent.
(ii) For the purpose of priority sector lending, ANBC denotes the outstanding Bank Credit in India [As prescribed in item No.VI of Form ‘A’ under Section 42 (2) of the RBI Act, 1934] minus bills rediscounted with RBI and other approved Financial Institutions plus permitted non-SLR bonds/debentures under Held to Maturity (HTM) category plus other investments eligible to be treated as part of priority sector lending (e.g. investments in securitised assets). The outstanding deposits under RIDF and other funds with NABARD, NHB, SIDBI and MUDRA Ltd. in lieu of non-achievement of priority sector lending targets/sub-targets will form part of ANBC. Advances extended in India against the incremental FCNR (B)/NRE deposits, qualifying for exemption from CRR/SLR requirements, as per the Reserve Bank’s
