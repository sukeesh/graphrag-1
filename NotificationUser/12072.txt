Madam/Dear Sir,
Reporting and Accounting of Central Government transactions of March 2021 – Change of date of closure
Please refer
Circular DGBA.GBD.No.S-140/42.01.029/2020-21 dated March 18, 2021
where in the date of closure for reporting residual transactions of March 2021 was fixed as April 10, 2021.
2. On account of holidays on April 10 and 11, 2021 (second Saturday and Sunday respectively), Government of India has now decided that the date of closure of residual transactions for the month of March 2021 be fixed as April 12, 2021. All agency banks may take note of the change of date of closure and ensure that arrangements are put in place to report all the March 2021 residual transactions by
1400 hours of April 12, 2021.
3. All other instructions contained in
Circular DGBA.GBD.No.S-140/42.01.029/2020-21 dated March 18, 2021
are operational and may be adhered to, taking into account closure date as April 12, 2021. To sum up, the nodal/Focal Point branches will be required to prepare separate set of scrolls, one pertaining to March 2021 residual transactions and another for April transactions during the first 12 days of April 2021. The Nodal/Focal Point branches should also ensure that the accounts for all transactions (revenues/tax collections/payments) up to March 31, 2021 are effected at the receiving branches in the accounts for financial year 2020-21 itself and are not mixed up with the transactions of April 2021. Also, while reporting transactions pertaining to March 2021 up to April 12, 2021, the transactions of April 2021 should not be mixed up with the residual transactions relating to March 2021.
4. Kindly issue necessary instructions in the matter to your branches concerned immediately.
Yours faithfully
