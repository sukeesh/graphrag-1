Dear Sir/Madam,
The  Depositor Education and Awareness Fund Scheme, 2014 –Section 26A of
Banking Regulation Act, 1949- Due diligence of  customers
Please refer to
circular  DBOD.No.DEAF Cell.BC.114/30.01.002/2013-14 dated May 27, 2014
on the  Depositor Education and Awareness Fund Scheme, 2014.
2. In terms of Paragraph  4 (i) of the Scheme, in case of  demand from a customer/ depositor whose unclaimed amount/deposit had been  transferred to the Fund, banks shall repay the customer/depositor, along with  interest, if applicable, and lodge a claim for refund from the Fund for an  equivalent amount paid to the customer/depositor.
3. In this regard, banks are once again advised to  follow the detailed instructions issued by us vide
circular  DBOD.No. Leg BC.34/09.07.005/2008-09 dated August 22, 2008
(for all  Scheduled commercial banks (excluding RRBs),
circular  UBD.BPD. (PCB) Cir. No. 9/13.01.000/2008-09 dated September 1, 2008
(for  all Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks),
circular  RPCD.CO.RF.BC.No. 89/07.38.01/2008-09 dated February 18, 2009
(for all  State and Central Co-operative Banks) and
circular  RPCD.CO. RRB.BC. No.108 / 03. 05. 33 / 2008-09 dated May 22, 2009
(for all  Regional Rural Banks), wherein it was advised that special efforts may be made  to trace the customers in respect of inoperative accounts.
4. However,  it is observed that, while accounts remained inoperative for ten years or more  and the customers/ claimants concerned were non-traceable, some banks have  claimed substantial refunds from the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund,  much too soon after transferring the amounts due to the Fund. It is not clear  as to how customers / claimants, who did not operate the account for ten years  or more, approached the banks for repayment immediately after the balances in  their inoperative accounts were transferred to the Fund. Banks should,  therefore, follow all instructions meticulously in respect of inoperative  accounts.
5. Further, proper due diligence as per the risk  category of the customers may also be carried out before making payments to the  customers approaching the banks for repayment. Banks are advised to invariably  verify the genuineness of the transactions and ensure that the amounts paid to  the customers are properly audited by the internal auditors/statutory auditors.
Yours faithfully,
(A. K.Pandey)
