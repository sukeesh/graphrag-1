Madam / Dear Sir,
White Label ATMs (WLAs) in  India – Clarification on Cash Handling
Please  refer to our
circular DPSS CO PD No. 2298/02.10.002/2011-12 dated June 20,  2012
laying down guidelines for non-bank entities to set up, own and operate  White Label ATMs in the country.
2. We have been  receiving certain queries on some of the provisions of above mentioned  circular. In particular, the issue relating to the perceived restrictions on  cash handling prescribed in Para A.4 of Annex B of the above circular “…..
At no point of time, the WLAO or his agents shall have access to the  cash at the WLAs”
has been raised in the recent meetings held with authorized WLAOs  and select banks to review the progress made so far in operationalization of  WLAs.
3.  It is hereby clarified that the rationale behind the instruction quoted above  was to ensure that the cash sourced from the sponsor bank only is loaded into  WLAs, thus ensuring quality / genuineness of the notes. However, subject to the  sourcing requirement discipline as stated in the aforesaid circular, taking  into consideration the difficulties expressed by stakeholders in  operationalizing the WLAs, last sentence of Para A.4 of Annex B to circular PSS  CO PD No. 2298 / 02.10.002 / 2011-12 dated June 20, 2012 reading as “
At no point of time, the WLAO or his agents  shall have access to the cash at the WLAs”
stands withdrawn with immediate effect.
4. Other instructions given in the circular  remain unchanged.
Yours faithfully
(Vijay  Chugh)
