Dear Sir/Madam,
Risk Weight for Consumer Credit except credit card receivables
Please refer to paragraph 6 of the
Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies dated August 7, 2019
on ‘Reduction in risk weight for consumer credit except credit card receivables’ (

).
2. As per extant instructions, consumer credit, including personal loans and credit card receivables but excluding educational loans, attracts a higher risk weight of 125 per cent or higher, if warranted by the external rating of the counterparty.
3. On a review, it has been decided to reduce the risk weight for consumer credit, including personal loans, but excluding credit card receivables, to 100%. Other stipulations remain the same.
Yours faithfully,
(Saurav Sinha)
