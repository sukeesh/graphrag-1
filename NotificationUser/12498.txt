Dear Sir/Madam,
Amendment to the Master Direction (MD) on KYC – Instructions on Wire Transfer
Please refer to the
Master Direction (MD) on KYC dated February 25, 2016

annexure
for reference. Further, definitions of the relevant terms used in the amended Wire Transfer instructions are being added in Section 2 (“Definitions”) of the MD on KYC.
3. The amended provisions shall come into force with immediate effect.
Yours faithfully,
