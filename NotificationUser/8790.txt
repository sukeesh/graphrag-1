Dear Sir / Madam,
Annual Closing of Government Accounts – Transactions of Central / State Governments – Special Measures for the Current Financial Year (2013-14)
We have been requested by the Government of India and some State Governments to facilitate collection and accounting of government transactions (such as receipts of taxes and revenue) for the current financial year (2013-14) up to March 31, 2014 keeping in view the likely rush of tax-payers towards the end of March 2014. Accordingly, it has been decided that all agency banks shall keep the counters of their designated branches conducting government business open for extended hours till 8.00 P.M. on Saturday, March 29 and Monday, March 31, 2014 at locations where March 31, 2014 has not been declared as a public holiday.
2. Further, on Sunday, March 30, 2014 and on Monday, March 31, 2014 (at places where holiday has been declared), agency banks may keep select branches open as a regular working day for transacting government business at key locations identified by them, based on volume of transactions. All electronic transactions would however continue till midnight on March 31, 2014. Banks may give due publicity about availability of banking facility for government business on these days.
3. As regards conduct of extended clearing sessions / operations on these dates, separate guidelines are being issued by our Department of Payment and Settlement Systems, Central Office, Mumbai.
Yours faithfully
