RBI/2014-15/226
RPCD.RRB.RCB.BC.No.32/03.05.33/2014-15
September 10,  2014
All Regional Rural Banks / State and Central  Co-operative Banks
Dear Sir/Madam,
Treatment of accounts opened for credit of  Scholarship
Amounts under Government Schemes
Please refer to our
circulars RPCD.CO.RRB.BC.No.41/03.05.33/2013-14 dated October  4, 2013
and
RPCD.RCB.BC.No.42/07.51.014/2013-14  dated October 7, 2013
advising Regional Rural Banks and State /  Central Cooperative Banks to allot a different “product code” in their  CBS to accounts opened by them for beneficiaries under the various Central /  State Government Schemes including scholarship schemes for students so that the  stipulation of inoperative / dormant account due to non-operation does not  apply.
2. Bombay High Court has brought to our notice  that banks fix a limit on total credits in zero balance accounts opened for  students studying in primary, secondary / higher secondary schools and  technical institutions. Resultantly, in cases where scholarship amounts exceed  the credit limit, banks do not allow the credit and return the amount to the  disbursement account of the Government. Further, in some cases banks are  reported to have closed zero balance accounts unilaterally without intimating  student beneficiaries concerned. Instances of banks refusing to open zero  balance account for students have also been brought to our notice.
3. As directed by the Bombay High Court, Regional  Rural Banks and State / Central  Cooperative Banks are hereby advised to ensure that accounts of all  student beneficiaries under the various Central/State Government Scholarship  Schemes are free from restrictions of ‘minimum balance’ and ‘total credit limit’.
4. Please acknowledge receipt to our Regional  Office.
Yours faithfully,
(A.Udgata)
