Madam / Dear Sir,
Resolution Framework - 2.0: Resolution of Covid-19 related stress of Micro, Small and
Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) – Revision in the threshold for aggregate exposure
A reference is invited to the
circular DOR.STR.REC.12/21.04.048/2021-22
on “Resolution Framework 2.0 – Resolution of Covid-19 related stress of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)” dated May 5, 2021.
2. Clause 2 of the above circular specifies the eligibility conditions for MSME accounts to be considered for restructuring under the framework, which
inter alia
include sub-clause (iii) which states that the aggregate exposure, including non-fund based facilities, of all lending institutions to the MSME borrower should not exceed ₹25 crore as on March 31, 2021.
3. Based on a review, it has been decided to enhance the above limit from ₹25 crore to ₹50 crore.
4. Consequently, clause 2(v) would stand modified as under:
“(v) The borrower’s account was not restructured in terms of the
circulars DOR.No.BP.BC/4/21.04.048/2020-21 dated August 6, 2020
;
DOR.No.BP.BC.34/21.04.048/2019-20 dated February 11, 2020
; or
DBR.No.BP.BC.18/21.04.048/2018-19 dated January 1, 2019
(collectively referred to as MSME restructuring circulars) or the
circular DOR.No.BP.BC/3/21.04.048/2020-21 dated August 6, 2020
on “Resolution Framework for COVID-19-related Stress.”
5. All other provisions of the circular remain unchanged.
Yours faithfully,
