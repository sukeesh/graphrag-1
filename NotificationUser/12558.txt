All Regulated Entities of the Bank
Dear Sir/ Madam,
Joining the Account Aggregator Ecosystem as Financial Information User
Please refer to the
Master Direction – Non-Banking Financial Company - Account Aggregator (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016
.
2. It has been observed that certain entities, which are eligible to join Account Aggregator (AA) ecosystem as Financial Information Provider (FIP), have onboarded as Financial Information User (FI-U) only. Consequently, such entities are accessing financial information from other FIPs but are not providing the financial information held by them. As such, with a view to ensure efficient and optimum utilisation of the AA ecosystem, it has been decided that regulated entities of the Bank joining the AA ecosystem as FI-U shall necessarily join as FIP also, if they hold the specified financial information and fall under the definition of FIP.
3. The
Master Direction – Non-Banking Financial Company - Account Aggregator (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016
, is being modified accordingly.
Yours faithfully,
(R. Lakshmi Kanth Rao)
Chief General Manager-in-Charge
