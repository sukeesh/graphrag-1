We consider the RWAs of the bank as on March 31 of previous financial year as ₹ 1000 crore.
Scenario
Maximum amount of AT1 bonds that can be raised overseas (in foreign currency and/or in rupee denominated bonds overseas)
Case I
The bank had AT1 capital of less than or equal to 1.5% of RWAs as on March 31 of the previous financial year.
Illustratively, the bank did not have any AT1 capital as on March 31 of the previous financial year.
Equals ₹ 7.35 crore (49% of 1.5% of RWAs).
Case II
The bank had AT1 capital more than 1.5% of RWAs as on March 31 of previous financial year.
Illustratively, the bank had AT1 capital of ₹ 50 crore as on March 31 of the previous financial year.
Equals 49% of ₹ 50 crore i.e. ₹ 24.5 crore (49% of total AT1 capital as it is more than 1.5% of RWAs).
Note: The amount of AT1 capital recognised for inclusion in Tier 1 capital will be subject to the limits mentioned in para 4.2.2 of the Basel III
Master Circular dated July 1, 2015
and para 1.3 of Annex 4 to the Master Circular ibid.
