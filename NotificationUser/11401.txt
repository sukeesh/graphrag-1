Madam / Dear Sir,
Fire Audit of Currency Chests - Clarification
Please refer to the instructions issued vide
DCM (CC) No.G-11/3445/03.39.01/2015-16 dated April 13, 2016
on ‘Security / Inspection Needs and Movement of Treasure’. We had advised all chest-maintaining banks to ensure that fire audits of currency chests are conducted once in two years by the officials from the District Fire Department.
2. We have been receiving references from various banks about non-availability of staff in State / District Fire Departments for getting the periodical fire audit conducted in their respective currency chests. The matter has been examined and it is decided that in case of non-availability of officials of the District Fire Department, the fire audit can also be conducted by the agencies approved by the respective State / District Fire Departments. Other instructions contained in our
circular dated April 13, 2016
remain unchanged.
Yours faithfully,
(Manas Ranjan Mohanty)
Chief General Manager
