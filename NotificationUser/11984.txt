LTV Ratio (%)
Risk Weight (%)
≤ 80
35
> 80 and ≤ 90
50
4. The requirement of standard asset provision of 0.25% shall continue to apply on all such loans.
5. The LTV ratios, Risk Weights and Standard Asset Provision for all loans sanctioned prior to the date of this circular shall continue to be as prescribed in terms of the
circular dated June 7, 2017
.
