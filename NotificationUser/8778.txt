Dear Sir/Madam,
End of Support for Windows XP
It is learnt that Microsoft will stop  issuing updates and patches for bugs in its Windows XP operating system  (released in 2001) from April 8, 2014. The probability of attacks on such a  system may increase and it may be difficult to defend such attacks in the  absence of Microsoft support.
2. As some of your systems, including  ATMs, may still be working on Windows XP, you are advised to take immediate  steps to implement appropriate systems and controls in this regard.
3. Please acknowledge the receipt of  this circular.
Yours faithfully
(A S  Ramasastri)
