All Asset Reconstruction Companies
Madam/ Sir,
Acquisition of financial assets by Asset Reconstruction Companies from sponsors and lenders
Please refer to para 2(A) of
Circular DNBS (PD) CC.No.37/SCRC/26.03.001/2013-2014 dated March 19, 2014
.
2. On a review, it has been decided that Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) shall not acquire financial assets from the following on a bilateral basis, whatever may be the consideration:
(i) a bank/ financial institution which is the sponsor of the ARC;
(ii) a bank/ financial institution which is either a lender to the ARC or a subscriber to the fund, if any, raised by the ARC for its operations;
(iii) an entity in the group to which the ARC belongs.
However, they may participate in auctions of the financial assets provided such auctions are conducted in a transparent manner, on armâ€™s length basis and the prices are determined by market forces.
Yours faithfully,
(Manoranjan Mishra)
Chief General Manager
