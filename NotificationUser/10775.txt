Dear Sir,
Preservation of CCTV recordings
Please refer to paragraph (5) of our
circular DCM (FNVD) No.1134/16.01.05/2016-17 dated October 27, 2016
wherein it was stated that in order to facilitate identification of people abetting circulation of counterfeit notes, banks are advised to cover the banking hall/area and counters under CCTV surveillance and recording and preserve the recording.
2. In continuation to the above, the banks are further advised to preserve CCTV recordings of operations at bank branches and currency chests for the period from November 08 to December 30, 2016, until further instructions, to facilitate coordinated and effective action by the enforcement agencies in dealing with matters relating to illegal accumulation of new currency notes.
3. Please acknowledge receipt.
Yours faithfully,
