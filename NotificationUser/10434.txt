4. For existing project loans where the aggregate exposure of all institutional lenders is minimum â‚¹ 1,000 crore, NBFCs may refinance such loans by way of full or partial take-out financing, even without a pre-determined agreement with other lenders, and fix a longer repayment period, and the same would not be considered as restructuring in the books of the existing as well as taking over lenders, if the following conditions are satisfied:

Such loans should be 'standard' in the books of the existing lenders at the time of the refinancing;
In case of partial take-out, a significant amount of the loan (a minimum 25% of the outstanding loan by value) should be taken over by a new set of lenders from the existing financing lenders; and
The promoters should bring in additional equity, if required, so as to reduce the debt to make the current debt-equity ratio and Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) of the project loan acceptable to the NBFCs.
5. A lender who has extended only working capital finance for a project may be treated as 'new lender' for taking over a part of the project term loan as required under the guidelines.
6. The above facility will be available only once during the life of the existing project loans.
Yours faithfully
