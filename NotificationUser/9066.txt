Area of Operation
Introduction
1.1
Area of Operation of  a primary (urban) co-operative bank (UCB) means the geographical area/s as  defined in its bye-laws, approved by the registering authority. UCBs may expand  their Area of Operation through a resolution passed by the general body and  getting the amended bye-laws registered with the Registrar of Co-operative  Societies (RCS)/Central Registrar of Co-operative Societies (CRCS). Banks are  required to seek prior permission (No Objection Certificate) from the Reserve  Bank of India for such revision, wherever applicable.
Regulatory  Requirements
Extension  of Area of Operation within the district of registration and adjoining  districts within the State of registration
1.2
Licensed Tier I and Tier II UCBs satisfying the  criteria stated below may extend their area of operation to the whole of the  district of registration and to its adjoining districts within their State of  registration, without prior permission from the Reserve Bank of India subject  to satisfying the following norms:
(a) CRAR not being  less than 10 per cent;
(b) Gross NPAs of  less than 7% and Net NPAs of not more than 3%;
(c) No default in the  maintenance of CRR / SLR during the preceding financial year;
(d) Continuous net profit  for the last three years;
(e)  Sound internal control systems with at least two professional directors on the  Board; and
(f) Regulatory  comfort based on, inter-alia, record of compliance with the provisions of  Banking
Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS), RBI Act, 1934  and the instructions / directions issued by RBI from  time to time.
The  Urban Co-operative Banks, which fulfill the above stated six norms, are called  “Financially Sound and Well Managed (FSWM)” UCBs.
Such  FSWM UCBs need not approach Reserve Bank of India for seeking ‘no objection’  for extension of area of operation as stated above. Such banks may directly  approach the RCS of the State concerned for extension of area of operation to  the entire district of registration and its adjoining districts within the  State of registration.
Extension  of Area of Operation beyond the adjoining districts and to the entire State of  registration
1.3
The uni-state Tier II UCBs may extend their  area of operation to the entire State of Registration  on fulfilling the conditions stipulated for FSWM UCBs.
1.4
Tier II UCBs registered or deemed to be  registered under the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002 satisfying  the criteria for FSWM UCBs will be permitted to extend their area of operation  to the entire State of original registration.
RBI  will consider requests for expansion of area of operation to the entire state  from licensed Tier II UCBs or UCBs registered or deemed to be registered under  the Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002 and which fulfil the above criteria  stated for FSWM UCBs as per the last RBI inspection. Also the Assessed Net Worth (ANW) of such FSWM  UCBs should not be less than the entry point capital norms prescribed for the  highest category centre in that district(s), applicable to a new general category bank, as indicated in
Annex I
. While  considering such applications, RBI will give due consideration to system of  internal controls prevailing in the bank and supervisory comfort. UCBs desirous  of extending their area of operation to the entire state may approach the Regional  Offices of Reserve Bank of India for prior approval.
1.5
For the purpose of classification of UCBs into  Tier I and II, the following definition may be adopted for all regulatory  purposes in super-session of instructions contained in
circular RBI Circular UBD.(PCB).Cir.No.35/09.20.001/07-08 dated  March 7, 2008
:
Tier  I Banks:
(i) Banks having deposits below
`
100 crore operating in a single district;
(ii)  Banks with deposits below
`
100 crore operating in more than one district will be  treated as Tier I provided the branches are in contiguous districts and  deposits and advances of branches in one district separately constitute at  least 95 per cent of the total deposits and advances respectively of the bank;  and
(iii)  Banks with deposits below
`
100 crore, whose branches were originally in a single  district but subsequently, became multi-district due to reorganisation of the  district may also be treated as Tier I UCBs.
Tier  II Banks:
All  other Banks
Note:  The deposit and advances as referred to in the definition may be reckoned as on  31st March of the immediate preceding financial year.
Extension  of Area of Operation beyond the State of registration and Extension of Area of  Operation of Multi-State UCBs
1.6
Financially  sound and well managed (FSWM) UCBs that  have a minimum assessed net worth of
`
50 crore, will henceforth, be allowed to extend  their area of operation beyond the State of registration as also to any other  State/s of their choice subject to the criteria stipulated for them as laid  down in Para 1.2 above.
Branch  Authorisation Policy
Introduction
2.1
In terms of Annual Policy Statements for the  year 2007-08 and 2008-09, it was decided to liberalise and rationalise the  branch authorisation norms for Financially Sound  and Well Managed (FSWM)  UCBs in the States  that have signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Reserve Bank of India and  those registered under Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act, 2002. The  present policy is given in the following paragraphs.
Authorisation  Policy - Eligibility Criteria
2.2
Financially sound and well  managed (FSWM) UCBs will be eligible to open branches/extension counters (ECs)  in their approved area of operation beyond the current annual ceiling of 10 per  cent and upgrade ECs which are in operation for more than three years, provided  they have the required headroom capital (prescribed in
Annex V
) in terms of  assessed net worth (ANW) per branch, including existing branches (methodology  given in
Annex VI)
and subject to fulfillment of the six criteria laid down in  Para 1.2 above. Such FSWM UCBs should maintain a minimum CRAR  of 10 per cent on a continuous basis with minimum ANW commensurate with the  prevalent entry point capital norms for the centre where branch is proposed /  where it is registered. Entry point norms for various categories of UCBs are  given in
Annex I
.
2.3
Banks which have been organised as unit banks  and have been extended relaxation in the entry point capital as indicated in
Annex I
, would be eligible to open branches only after augmenting their Assessed  Net Worth (ANW) to the level required for opening a new general category bank  at the place where the bank was organised or where the branch is desired to be  opened, whichever is higher. For instance, if a unit bank was organised at a category  ‘D’ centre and it intends to open a branch at a ‘B’ category centre, such  bank’s ANW should necessarily be raised to entry point capital prescribed for  organising a general category bank at a ‘B’ category centre.
2.4
Similarly if a bank, other than a unit bank,  desires to open a branch at a higher category centre, other than the centre at  which it was established, within the district of its registration, the ANW of  the bank should at least be equivalent to the entry point capital prescribed  for that centre. Illustratively, if a bank situated at ‘C’ category centre  intends to open a branch at ‘B’ category centre, in the same district, its ANW should  be equivalent to the entry point capital prescribed for ‘B’ category centre.
2.5
However, a bank which desires to open a branch  at a centre, other than its district of registration but within the state of  registration, must have ANW not less than the entry point capital required for  organisation of a new general category bank at the highest category centre in  that state. Illustratively, if a bank registered in district ‘X’ desires to  open a branch in district ‘Y’ within its state of registration, then its ANW should not be less than the entry point capital  required for highest category centre in the state.
Selection  of Centres
2.6
UCBs, satisfying the above  mentioned norms may prepare an Annual Business Plan (ABP) for opening of  branches (including extension counters and up-gradation of extension counters  into full-fledged branches, in their existing area of operation, for the next 12 months, with the approval of their Board of Directors  and submit the ABP, in duplicate, along with Annexes
II
,
III
,
IV
and
VI
to the respective Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India. The plan may be submitted preferably by end  of December of the previous financial year.
2.7
Where the banks have opened extension counters  without complying with the prescribed norms and subsequently approach Reserve  Bank of India for up-gradation of the same into full-fledged branches, such  banks would not be allotted centres unless they close unauthorised extension  counters. Further, a centre where a bank has opened an unauthorised extension  counter, such a centre would not be considered for opening a branch in future.
2.8
Scheduled UCBs which comply with the  eligibility norms indicated at Para 1.2 above  may open mobile/satellite offices. Such of the scheduled banks which desire to  open mobile/satellite offices may indicate the same in the format as per
Annex IV
enclosed to this circular along with other centres  where they intend to open branches.
2.9
Banks need not indicate the exact address of the  proposed branch in the ABP but may only indicate the place of business  including the name of the town/city within their area of operation, in the  order of their preference, where they desire to open branches. Banks should  choose the centres at which they wish to open branches after careful  consideration of business potential and availability of premises at such  centres.
2.10
A list of centres where a bank desires to open  branches under the ABP should be indicated in the format as per
Annex IV
enclosed  to this circular, and only one application need to be sent. The banks should  not submit statements/ annexes, which are not required/called for, but submit  only the requisite information/data, along with a certified copy of the latest  audited balance sheet (as of 31 March) or a copy of the published Annual Report  of the bank.
Approval  for Centres
2.11
The banks which comply with the prescribed  norms (Para 1.2) will be allotted centres  strictly in the order of preference given by them. Once a centre is allotted,  no request for change in the allotted centre would be entertained.
Authorisation  and its Validity Period
2.12
A valid authorisation from the Reserve Bank of  India is required for opening a new place of business including extension  counters, off-site ATMs or changing the location of any existing place of  business (except to the extent permitted vide paragraphs 5.1 to 5.5) under Section  23 of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS). After making arrangements for opening of  branches, the bank should approach the Regional Offices of Urban Banks  Department under whose jurisdiction they operate, in the prescribed Form V,  indicating the exact postal address of the place where the branch is to be  opened, for issuance of authorisation within a period of six months from the  date of allotment of the centre.
2.13
Authorisation will be valid for one year from  the date of issue, or one and a half year from the date of allotment of the  centre, whichever is earlier. Ordinarily, no extension of time will be granted  after the expiry of validity period of licence. Only in exceptional cases,  where the bank is unable to open the branch for reasons beyond its control, an  extension of time not exceeding six months may be granted by the Regional  Offices, under advice to Central Office.
2.14
Opening of branches without a valid  authorisation from the Reserve Bank is an act of violation of Section 23 of the  BR Act, 1949 (AACS), and liable to attract penalties.
2.15
In case, the information/particulars furnished  by any bank are found to be incorrect, the Reserve Bank of India will take a  serious view in the matter and the bank will be liable for penal action,  including debarring it from allotment of centres for a period of three years.

UCBs desirous of opening specialised branches may include them  in their Annual Business Plan explaining the need and objective for opening  such centres.
3.3
The specialised branches should be fully  computerized and should be opened with in the Area of Operation of a UCB and  should be based on a cluster approach.

Co-operative Banks for their Use i.e., for  Office and Residence of Staff
12.1
The authorisations issued for opening of bank  branches / offices are location-specific in as much as, in terms of the extant instructions,  Reserve Bank of India issues authorisation / permission for opening a bank  branch / office at a particular centre based on the exact postal address of the  place where the branch / office is to be opened. In the circumstances, it is  incumbent upon banks to ensure that their branches are operating from premises,  which have a subsisting and valid lease agreement, free of any dispute between  the bank and the landlords of the premises in question. Therefore, Head Offices  of banks were advised to undertake a review in this regard.
12.2
Banks are  required to furnish quarterly progress reports (as at the end of March, June,  September and December) as per the format given at Annex

to enable  RBI to take a view on the appropriateness, or otherwise, of continuing the  authorization for the branch / office which is functioning in a 'disputed'  premises, to the RD of the Regional Office of RBI concerned, within a period of  one month from the close of the respective quarter to which the report relates.
