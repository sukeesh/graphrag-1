All Agency Banks (dealing with pension payments)
Dear Sir / Madam
Customer Service provided by agency banks
Please refer to our circular no.DGBA.GAD.H-3085/45.01.001/2008-09 dated October 1, 2008 on the captioned subject.
2. We are receiving complaints from various quarters that pensioners are not being treated with due consideration by bank officials, specifically the old pensioners, when they come to the branches for pension related transactions.
3. Thus, all agency banks disbursing pension are advised to provide considerate and sympathetic customer service to the pensioners, specially to those pensioners who are of old age.
Yours faithfully
