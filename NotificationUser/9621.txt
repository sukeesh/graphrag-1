Dear Sirs,
Implementation  of Section 51-A of UAPA, 1967-UNSCR 1267(1999)/1989(2011) Committee’s Al Qaida  Sanctions List and UNSCR 1988 (2011) Taliban Sanctions List- Modification in  the Listing Format
A  reference is invited to our circulars issued from time to time advising about  amendments /additions/ deletions to UNSCR 1267(1999) /1989 (2011) Al Qaida  Sanction list and UNSCR 1988 (2011) Taliban Sanctions List.
2. Government of India, Ministry of  External Affairs has now advised that the United Nations Sanction Committee has  adopted a new listing format which is designed for all Sanctions Committees.  The key modification in the new list is a newer permanent referencing system  that is harmonized with all other United Nations Sanction Lists.
3. The new  version of the List is available at
http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/aq_sanctions_list_new.shtml
and a detailed explanation of how  the referencing system has been changed has been given at
http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/changes_newlist_format.shtml
(copy enclosed).
4. MEA has further informed that with effect from March 1,  2015, the Al-Qaida/Taliban Sanctions list prepared based on the previous format  will no longer be available on the Committee's web site and will be replaced by  the modified new version as referred above. The new lists and the consolidated  UNSC Sanctions List, will continue to be available at:
http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/aq_sanctions_list_new.shtml
http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1988/list_new.shtml
and

MEA has also suggested that new  format be referred while making reference to any individual or entity on the  sanction list.
Yours faithfully,
