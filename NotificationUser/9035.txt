Master Circular on Appointment & Delisting of Brokers and
Payment of Brokerage on Relief/Savings Bonds
A. APPOINTMENT/DELISTING OF BROKERS
1. Procedure for enrollment/registration of brokers
Agency banks may follow a simple procedure for enrollment/registration of brokers. The broker seeking enrollment/registration may submit the request for registration on their business letterhead together with business data to the agency banks. The agency banks should allot a code number to the broker which should be quoted by the broker on all applications tendered at the Receiving offices for claiming brokerage.
(Ref. No CO.DT./13.01.201/692/2000-01 dated August 9, 2000)
2. Appointment of sub-agents by Agency banks
It has come to our notice that some banks designated/authorized by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have engaged the services of other banks as brokers/agents for receiving applications and the latter are using the name of RBI in their publicity material and billboards stating that RBI has appointed them as brokers for Relief/Savings bonds business. We advise that in cases where authorised banks engage the services of other banks/institutions as a broker or agent, the agency banks who have appointed them are solely responsible for their activities as an agent/broker. RBI's name should not be used by such banks.
(Ref. CO.DT./13.01.251/ 5341/2001-02 dated January 4, 2002)
3. Delisting of brokers
The names of the dormant brokers, who have been dormant for say 2 years, may be delisted after giving a due notice if, no fresh business is forthcoming from these brokers.
