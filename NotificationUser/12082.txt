Dear Sir/ Madam,
Utilisation of Floating Provisions/Counter Cyclical Provisioning Buffer
Please refer to our
circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.89/21.04.048/2005-06 dated June 22, 2006
and
DBOD.No.BP.BC.68/21.04.048/2006-07 dated March 13, 2007
on creation, accounting, disclosures and utilisation of floating provisions by banks. Banks may also refer to our
circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.87/21.04.048/2010-11 dated April 21, 2011
on creation and utilisation of ‘countercyclical provisioning buffer’, wherein we had advised that the buffer will be allowed to be used by banks for making specific provisions for non-performing assets, inter alia, during periods of system wide downturn, with the prior approval of RBI.
2. Accordingly, in terms of our circulars
DBOD.No.BP.95/21.04.048/2013-14 dated February 7, 2014
and
DBR.No.BP.BC.79/21.04.048/2014-15 dated March 30, 2015
, banks were allowed to utilise upto 33 per cent and 50 per cent of floating provisions/ countercyclical provisioning buffer held by them as on March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 respectively, for making specific provisions for non-performing assets, as per their Board approved policy.
3. In order to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID 19 related stress on banks, as a measure to enable capital conservation, it has been decided to allow banks to utilise 100 per cent of floating provisions/ countercyclical provisioning buffer held by them as on December 31, 2020 for making specific provisions for non-performing assets with prior approval of their Boards. Such utilisation is permitted with immediate effect and upto March 31, 2022.
Yours faithfully,
(Manoranjan Mishra)
