Madam / Dear Sir,
KYC – Clarification on Proof of Address
Please refer to our
circular  RPCD.RRB.RCB.AML.BC.No.111/07.51.018/2013-14 dated June 12, 2014
on the captioned subject.  In this regard we also draw your attention to our
circular  RPCD.RRB.RCB.AML.No.2797/07.51.018/2014-15 dated September 9, 2014
, forwarding copies of a Press Release dated August 26, 2014  and a poster on KYC simplification measures initiated by us.
2. In this regard, it has been brought to our  notice that despite issuing clear instructions regarding the requirement of one  proof of address whether permanent or current, some banks are still insisting  on submission of a proof of address for the current address even when a  customer produces a proof of permanent address, which prevents many prospective  customers, especially migrant workers, from opening bank accounts.
3. In view of the above, banks are advised to  ensure that customers are not unnecessarily asked to submit additional proofs  of addresses for current addresses in cases where proofs of addresses for  permanent addresses are already available. RRBs and StCBs/CCBs are requested to  confirm to our Regional Offices concerned latest by November 7, 2014, that the  above mentioned instruction has been communicated to all their branches and the  same have been meticulously complied with.
Yours  faithfully,
(A.G.  Ray)
General Manager
