Dear Sir / Madam,
Export Credit in Foreign Currency – Benchmark Rate
Please refer to
Master Circular DBR.No.DIR.BC.14/04.02.002/2015-16 dated July 1, 2015
on Rupee / Foreign Currency Export Credit and Customer Service to Exporters.
2. As per the extant guidelines, authorized dealers are permitted to extend Pre-shipment Credit in Foreign Currency (PCFC) to exporters for financing the purchase, processing, manufacturing or packing of goods prior to shipment at LIBOR/EURO LIBOR/EURIBOR related rates of interest.
3. In view of the impending discontinuance of LIBOR as a benchmark rate, it has been decided to permit banks to extend export credit using any other widely accepted Alternative Reference Rate in the currency concerned. All other instructions in this regard shall remain unchanged.
Yours faithfully,
(Manoranjan Mishra)
