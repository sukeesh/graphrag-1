Dear Sir/Madam
Money Market Futures
As announced in the
first Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2016-17
, it has been decided to introduce Interest Rate Futures based on any rupee denominated money market interest rate or money market instrument on SEBI authorised stock exchanges.
2. In this regard, the Reserve Bank of India has issued a
Notification FMRD.DIRD.09/2016 dated October 28, 2016
amending the Interest Rate Futures (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2013 dated December 5, 2013 to permit cash settled interest rate futures based on money market benchmarks in general.
3. It may be noted that RBI had already permitted introduction of futures based on the 91-day Treasury Bill, which is a money market instrument. The purpose of the current directions is to permit futures based on any money market instrument or money market interest rate, other than the 91-day Treasury Bill Futures, which has been already permitted.
4. Registered exchanges are free to select the underlying instrument or interest rate and structure other details of the contracts. However, before any new or modified futures contract is introduced for trading on the exchanges, the registered exchanges shall submit complete details of the futures contract, duly ratified by SEBI, to the Reserve Bank for approval.
5. A copy of the Interest Rate Futures (Reserve Bank) (Amendment) Directions, 2016 which is placed on the RBI Website, is enclosed.
Yours faithfully
