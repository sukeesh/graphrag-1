Dear Sir/Madam,
Inoperative  Accounts
Please refer to paragraph 2(iv) of our
Circular  DBOD.No.Leg.BC.34/09.07.005/2008-09 dated August 22, 2008
on Unclaimed  Deposits/Inoperative Accounts in Banks in terms of which a savings as well as  current account should be treated as inoperative/dormant if there are no  transactions in the account for over a period of two years. Further, in terms  of paragraph 2(vi), for the purpose of classifying an account as inoperative,  both the types of transactions i.e. debit as well as credit transactions  induced at the instance of customers as well as third party should be  considered.
2. There may be instances where the customer  has given a mandate for crediting dividend on shares to Savings Bank account  and there are no other operations in the Savings Bank account. Some doubts have  arisen whether such an account is to be treated as inoperative account after  two years.
3. In this connection, we  clarify that since dividend on shares is credited to Savings Bank accounts as  per the mandate of the customer, the same should be treated as a customer  induced transaction. As such, the account should be treated as operative  account as long as the dividend is credited to the Savings Bank account. The  Savings Bank account can be treated as inoperative account only after two years  from the date of the last credit entry of the dividend, provided there is no  other customer induced transaction.
Yours faithfully,
(Sudarshan  Sen)
