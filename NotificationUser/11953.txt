Madam / Dear Sir,
Submission of returns under Section 31 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) – Extension of time
In terms of section 31 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (“the Act”) read with Section 56 the Act [as amended by the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Ordinance, 2020], accounts and balance-sheet referred to in section 29 of the Act together with the auditor's report shall be published in the prescribed manner and three copies thereof shall be furnished as returns to the Reserve Bank within three months from the end of the period to which they refer. In terms of the first proviso to the above section, Reserve Bank may in any case extend the said period of three months for the furnishing of such returns by a further period not exceeding three months.
2. Since the aforesaid Ordinance amending, inter alia, Section 31 has been notified on June 29, 2020 for the primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs) and also as UCBs may be facing difficulties in submission of the returns due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is considered necessary to allow more time for submission of the aforesaid return for the financial year ended on March 31, 2020.
3. In view of the above, Reserve Bank hereby extends the said period of three months for the furnishing of the returns under Section 31 of the Act for the financial year ended on March 31, 2020 by a further period of three months. Accordingly, all UCBs shall ensure submission of the aforesaid returns to Reserve Bank on or before September 30, 2020.
Yours faithfully,
(Neeraj Nigam)
