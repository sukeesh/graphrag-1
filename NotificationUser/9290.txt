B.  Off-Balance Sheet Items
The credit risk exposure attached to off-Balance  Sheet items has to be first calculated by multiplying the face value of each of  the off-Balance Sheet items by ‘credit conversion factor’ as indicated in the  table below. This will then have to be again multiplied by the weights  attributable to the relevant counter-party as specified above.
