The  Chief Executive Officers of
All  Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks
Madam/ Dear Sir,
Deferred Tax Liability on Special Reserve created  under
Section 36(1) (viii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961-UCBs
It has been observed that some banks are not creating  deferred tax liability (DTL) on Special Reserve as per Accounting Standard 22:
'Accounting  for taxes on Income
' (AS 22) on the ground that they do not intend to  withdraw from such Reserve in the future. In many cases banks have formalised  such intent by having resolutions passed by their Boards or Committees to this  effect.
2. The matter regarding creation of DTL on Special  Reserve has been examined and banks are advised that, as a matter of prudence,  DTL should be created on Special Reserve.
3. For this purpose, banks may take the following  course of action:
a) If the expenditure due to the  creation of DTL on Special Reserve as at March 31, 2013 has not been fully  charged to the Profit and Loss account, banks may adjust the same directly from  Reserves. The amount so adjusted may be appropriately disclosed in the Notes to  Accounts of the financial statements for the financial year 2013-14.
b) DTL for amounts transferred to  Special Reserve from the year ended March 31, 2014 onwards should be charged to  the Profit and Loss Account of that year.
4. In view  of the requirement to create DTL on Special Reserve, banks may reckon the  entire Special Reserve for the purpose of computing Tier-I Capital
Yours  faithfully,
(P.  K. Arora)
