2. In view of the ongoing stress and heightened uncertainty on account of COVID-19, it is imperative that banks continue to conserve capital to support the economy and absorb losses. In order to further strengthen the banksâ€™ balance sheets, while at the same time support lending to the real economy, it has been decided that banks shall not make any dividend payment on equity shares from the profits pertaining to the financial year ended March 31, 2020.
Yours faithfully,
(Usha Janakiraman)
Chief General Manager
