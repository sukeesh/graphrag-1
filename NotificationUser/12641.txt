Madam / Dear Sir
Currency Chests (CCs) operations on March 31, 2024
The Government of India has advised all branches of the banks dealing with Government receipts and payments to be kept open for transactions on Sunday, March 31, 2024 so as to account for the Government transactions relating to receipts and payments in FY 2023-24 itself. Since such transactions might necessitate operations at currency chests, the currency chest holding banks are advised to keep their CCs open on March 31, 2024, akin to a normal working day.
2. The CC holding banks shall keep the linked branches suitably informed.
Yours faithfully,
(Sanjeev Prakash)
Chief General Manager
