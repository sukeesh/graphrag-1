BENCHMARK
6. Internal Benchmark
(a) Base Rate
(i) All floating rate rupee loans sanctioned and renewed between July 1, 2010 and March 31, 2016
shall be priced with reference to the Base Rate which will be the internal benchmark for such purposes.
(ii) Base Rate shall include all those elements of the lending rates that are common across all categories of borrowers.
(iii) There can be only one Base Rate for each bank.
(iv) Banks shall have the freedom to calculate cost of funds either on the basis of average cost of funds or on marginal cost of funds or any other methodology in vogue, which is reasonable and transparent, subject to it being consistent and made available for supervisory review/scrutiny as and when required.
Provided
that where the card rate for deposits of one or more tenor is the basis, the deposits in the chosen tenor/s shall have the largest share in the deposit base of the bank.
(v) Banks shall review the Base Rate at least once in a quarter with the approval of the Board or the Asset Liability Management Committees (ALCOs) as per the bank’s practice.
(vi) Banks shall not review the Base Rate methodology for at least a period of three years from date of its finalization.
Provided
that this shall not apply to banks that have commenced their banking operations in India after September 2, 2013. Such banks shall be permitted to revise their Base Rate methodology once within a year from the date of commencement of their business operations in India.
(b) Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR)
(i) All
floating rate
rupee loans sanctioned and renewed w.e.f. April 1, 2016 shall be priced with reference to the Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) which will be the internal benchmark for such purposes
subject to the provisions contained in paragraph 7 of this Master Direction.
(ii) The MCLR shall comprise of:
Marginal cost of funds;
Negative carry on account of CRR;
Operating costs;
Tenor premium.
(iii) Marginal Cost of funds
The marginal cost of funds shall comprise of Marginal cost of borrowings and return on networth. The detailed methodology for computing marginal cost of funds is given in the
Annex
.
(iv) Negative Carry on CRR
Negative carry on the mandatory CRR which arises due to return on CRR balances being nil, will be calculated as under:
Required CRR x (marginal cost) / (1- CRR)
The marginal cost of funds arrived at (iii) above shall be used for arriving at negative carry on CRR.
(v) Operating Costs
All operating costs associated with providing the loan product including cost of raising funds shall be included under this head. It shall be ensured that the costs of providing those services which are separately recovered by way of service charges do not form part of this component.
(vi) Tenor premium
These costs arise from loan commitments with longer tenor. The change in tenor premium should not be borrower specific or loan class specific. In other words, the tenor premium will be uniform for all types of loans for a given residual tenor.
(vii) The tenor of the MCLR calculated as per the
Annex
shall correspond to the following:
the tenor of the funds in the single largest maturity bucket, provided it is more than 30 percent of the entire funds (other than equity) reckoned for determining the MCLR , or
the weighted average tenor of two or more maturity buckets that together account for more than 30 percent, if no single maturity bucket accounts for more than 30 percent of the funds. The maturity bucket shall be arrived at by calculating the cumulative weightage based on the descending order of the maturity time buckets.
(viii) Since MCLR will be a tenor linked benchmark, banks shall arrive at the MCLR of
various maturities by incorporating
the corresponding tenor premium
/ discount
to the sum of Marginal cost of funds, Negative carry on account of CRR and Operating costs. Accordingly, banks shall publish the internal benchmark for the following maturities:
overnight MCLR,
one-month MCLR,
three-month MCLR,
six month MCLR,
One year MCLR.
In addition to the above, banks shall have the option of publishing MCLR of any other longer maturity.
(ix) Review of MCLR
(a) Banks shall review and publish their Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR) of different maturities every month on a pre-announced date with the approval of the Board or any other committee to which powers have been delegated.
(b) Banks which do not have adequate systems to carry out the review of MCLR on a monthly basis, shall review their rates once a quarter on a pre-announced date for the first one year i.e. upto March 31, 2017.
Provided
that, such banks shall adopt the monthly review of MCLR as mentioned in section 6(b)(ix)(a) above.
7. External Benchmark
(a) All new floating rate personal or retail loans (housing, auto, etc.) and floating rate loans
extended by banks
to Micro and Small Enterprises from October 01, 2019
and floating rate loans to Medium Enterprises from April 01, 2020
shall be benchmarked to one of the following:
- Reserve Bank of India policy repo rate
- Government of India 3-Months Treasury Bill yield published by the Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd (FBIL)
- Government of India 6-Months Treasury Bill yield published by the FBIL
- Any other benchmark market interest rate published by the FBIL.
(b) Banks are free to offer such external benchmark linked loans to other types of borrowers as well.
(c) In order to ensure transparency, standardisation, and ease of understanding of loan products by borrowers, a bank must adopt a uniform external benchmark within a loan category; in other words, the adoption of multiple benchmarks by the same bank is not allowed within a loan category.

Deposits
a
Current Deposits
The core portion of current deposits identified based on the guidelines on Asset Liability Management issued vide circular dated October 24, 2007 should be reckoned for arriving at the balance outstanding.
b
Savings Deposits
The core portion of savings deposits identified based on the guidelines on Asset Liability Management issued vide circular dated October 24, 2007 should be reckoned for arriving at the balance outstanding.
c
Term deposits (Fixed Rate)
Term deposits of various maturities including those on which differential interest rates are payable should be included.
d
Term deposits (Floating Rate)
The rate should be arrived at based on the prevailing external benchmark rate on the date of review.
e
Foreign currency deposits
Foreign currency deposits, to the extent deployed for lending in rupees, should be included in computing marginal cost of funds. The swap cost and hedge cost of such deposits should be reckoned for computing marginal cost.
2
Borrowings
a
Short term Rupee Borrowings
Interest payable on each type of short term borrowing will be arrived at using the average rates at which such short term borrowings were raised in the last one month. For eg. Interest on borrowings from RBI under LAF will be the average interest rate at which a bank has borrowed from RBI under LAF during the last one month.
b
Long term Rupee Borrowings
Option 1:
Interest payable on each type of long term borrowing will be arrived at using the average rates at which such long term borrowings were raised.
Option 2:
The appropriate benchmark yield for bank bonds published by FIMMDA for valuation purposes will be used as the proxy rate for calculating marginal cost.
c
Foreign Currency Borrowings including HO borrowings by foreign banks (other than those forming part of Tier-I capital)
Foreign currency borrowings, to the extent deployed for lending in rupees, should be included in computing marginal cost of funds. The all-in-cost of raising foreign currency borrowings including swap cost and hedge cost would be reckoned for computing marginal cost of funds.
Marginal cost of borrowings
The marginal cost of borrowings shall have a weightage of 92% of Marginal Cost of Funds while return on networth will have the balance weightage of 8%.
B
Return on networth
Amount of common equity Tier 1 capital required to be maintained for Risk Weighted Assets as per extant capital adequacy norms shall be included for computing marginal cost of funds. Since currently, the common equity Tier 1 capital is (5.5% +2.5%) 8% of RWA, the weightage given for this component in the marginal cost of funds will be 8%.
In case of newly set up banks (either domestic or foreign banks operating as branches in India) where lending operations are mainly financed by capital, the weightage for this component may be higher ie in proportion to the extent of capital deployed for lending. This dispensation will be available for a period of three years from the date of commencing operations.
The cost of equity will be the minimum desired rate of return on equity computed as a mark-up over the risk free rate. Banks could follow any pricing model such as Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to arrive at the cost of capital. This rate can be reviewed annually.
Marginal cost of funds = 92% x Marginal cost of borrowings + 8% x Return on networth
Note:
Banks shall have the option to reckon the outstanding balances of deposits and other borrowings as on any day, not more than seven calendar days, prior to the date from which the MCLR becomes effective. The chosen time lag shall be maintained consistently for a period not less one year.
