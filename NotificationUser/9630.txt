Attention of Authorized Dealers Category – I (AD Category – I) banks is  invited to the Foreign Exchange Management (Foreign Exchange Derivative  Contracts) Regulations, 2000 dated May 3, 2000 (

Increase in limits without establishing underlying  exposure
2. Presently, FPIs can take position – both long (bought) as well as short(sold)  – in foreign currency up to USD 10 million or equivalent per exchange . As a  measure of further liberalisation, it has now been decided to increase the  limit (long as well as short) for FPIs in USD-INR pair upto USD 15 million per  exchange. In addition, FPIs shall be allowed to take long (bought) as well as  short (sold) positions in EUR-INR, GBP-INR and JPY-INR pairs, all put together,  upto USD 5 million equivalent per exchange. These limits shall be monitored by  the exchanges and breaches, if any, may be reported. For the convenience of monitoring, exchanges  may prescribe fixed limits for the contracts in currencies other than USD such  that these limits are within the equivalent of USD 5 million.
3. All other operational guidelines, terms and  conditions shall remain unchanged.
4. This circular has been issued under Sections 10 (4) and 11(1) of the  Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999) and is without prejudice to  permissions / approvals, if any, required under any other law.
Yours faithfully,
