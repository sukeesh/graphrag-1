2. A reference is invited to
Part B of the First Bi-monthly Monetary  Policy Statement 2014-15 announced on April 1, 2014
proposing  certain measures for consumer protection. It was indicated that in the interest  of their consumers, banks should consider allowing their borrowers the possibility  of prepaying floating rate term loans without any penalty. Accordingly, it is  advised that StCBs, CCBs and RRBs will not be permitted to charge foreclosure  charges/ pre-payment penalties on all floating rate term loans sanctioned to
individual  borrowers
, with immediate effect.
Yours faithfully,
