2. In  terms of Section 26A(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, in respect of  unclaimed amount transferred to the Depositor Education and Awareness Fund  (Fund), a banking company shall be liable to repay a depositor or any other  claimant, claiming his deposit or unclaimed amount, at such rate of interest as  may be specified by the Reserve Bank in this behalf. In terms of Section 26A(3)  of the said Act, where a banking company has paid such amount or allowed  operation of such account or deposit, such banking company may apply for refund  of such amount from the Fund. Accordingly, Reserve Bank hereby specifies that the  rate of interest payable by banks to the depositors/ claimants on the unclaimed  interest bearing deposit amount transferred to the Fund shall be 4% simple  interest per annum until further notice. The amount of interest payable in this behalf  shall be calculated in the manner specified in paragraph 4 (ii) of the Scheme and  by rounding off the amount of interest to the nearest rupee.
