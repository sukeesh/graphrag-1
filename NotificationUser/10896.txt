All Agency Banks
Dear Sir/ Madam,
Opening of all Agency Banks for government business on April 1, 2017 – Revised instructions
We had vide our
circular DBR.No.Leg. BC.55/09.07.005/2016-17 dated March 24, 2017
advised all Agency Banks to keep all their branches dealing with government business open on all days in the current financial year and on April 1, 2017 (including Saturday, Sunday and all holidays).
2. In this connection, it has been represented that the opening of bank branches on April 1, 2017 may disrupt the annual closing, especially in view of merger of some banks taking effect from that date. In consultation with Government of India, it has, therefore, been decided that while the Agency Banks are to keep all their branches dealing with government business open on all days in the current financial year (including Saturday, Sunday and all holidays) as already advised, these branches need not be kept open on April 1, 2017.
Yours faithfully,
(Rajinder Kumar)
Chief General Manager
