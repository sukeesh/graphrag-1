All Agency Banks
Dear Sir / Madam,
Prompt implementation of Governments’ instructions by agency banks
It is brought to our notice that some agency banks are not adhering to instructions/ notifications issued by Government (Central as well as States) promptly by stating that further communications have not been received by them from RBI.
2. In this connection, all agency banks are advised to scrupulously follow all the guidelines /instructions contained in various notifications of Government (Central as well as States) and take necessary actions immediately without waiting for any further instructions from RBI.
3. It is further advised that for queries related to such guidelines /instructions agency banks may take up the issue directly with concerned Governments and if the queries are related to reporting to RBI, then it may be addressed to DGBA /CAS, Nagpur.
Yours faithfully,
(Partha Choudhuri)
General Manager
