For the purpose of these directions:-
2.1 (i) An interest rate option is a financial derivative contract whose value is based on Rupee interest rates.

(iv) An option which could be exercised by the buyer on the expiration date is called a European option.
(v) An interest rate cap is a series of interest rate call options (called caplets) in which the buyer of the option receives a payment at the end of each period when the underlying interest rate is above a rate agreed in advance (strike rate).
