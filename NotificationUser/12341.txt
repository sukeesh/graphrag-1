(collectively referred to as “e-mandate framework”). The e-mandate framework prescribed an Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA), inter alia, while processing the first transaction in case of e-mandates / standing instructions on cards, prepaid payment instruments and Unified Payments Interface. For subsequent transactions with transaction values up to ₹5,000/- (AFA limit), prescription of AFA was waived.
2. On a review of implementation of the e-mandate framework and the protection available to customers, it has been decided to increase the aforesaid AFA limit from ₹5,000/- to ₹15,000/- per transaction.
3. This circular is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007), and shall come into effect immediately.
Yours faithfully,
(P. Vasudevan)
