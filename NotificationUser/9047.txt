1. Introduction
1.1 The Reserve Bank  of India (RBI) provides export credit refinance facility to banks under Section  17(3A) of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934. This facility is given on the  basis of banks’ eligible outstanding rupee export credit both at the  pre-shipment and post-shipment stages. The quantum of refinance is fixed from  time to time based on the stance of monetary policy of the RBI.
2. Eligible  Institutions
2.1 All scheduled  banks (excluding RRBs), which are authorised dealers in foreign exchange and  have extended export credit are eligible to avail of the export credit  refinance facility.
3. Limit
3.1 At present, the  scheduled banks are provided export credit refinance to the extent of 32.0 per cent of the outstanding export credit  eligible for refinance as at the end of the second preceding fortnight. This  limit was reduced from 50.0 per cent to 32.0 per cent, vide
circular  No.MPD.BC.372/07.01.279/2013-14 dated June 3, 2014
. The definition of  outstanding export credit eligible for refinance is given in Annex I.
4. Interest  Rate
4.1 Export credit  refinance facility is available at the Repo Rate under the Liquidity Adjustment  Facility (LAF), as announced from time to time.
4.2 Interest shall be  payable with monthly rests and the amounts of such interest calculated on daily  balances would be debited to the current account of the banks at the end of  respective month or earlier when the balance outstanding is wiped out.
5. Margin  Requirement
5.1 No margin is  required to be maintained.
6. Duration
6.1 The ECR is repayable  on demand or on the expiry of fixed periods not exceeding one hundred and  eighty days, subject to a minimum tenor of one day.
7. Collateral
7.1 The RBI extends  the export credit refinance against the Demand Promissory Note (DPN) of banks  supported by a declaration that they have extended export credit and the  outstanding amount eligible for refinance is not less than the loan/advance  from the RBI.
8. Minimum Amount of Availment
8.1 The minimum  amount of availment under this facility is Rupees one lakh and multiples  thereof.
9. Place  of Availment
9.1 This facility can  be availed of at centres wherever the Reserve Bank has a Banking Department.
10. Penalties
10.1  In the event  of a scheduled bank having irregular availment of export credit refinance, a penal rate of  interest as decided by the Reserve Bank from time to time will be charged on  the outstanding loan or loans. Currently, the penal rate is 3 per cent above  the repo rate.
10.2 An illustrative  (but not exhaustive) list of instances on which penal rate would be applicable  for irregular availment of export credit refinance is set out below:
a) Utilisation of ECR exceeding the total limit.
b) Wrong calculation/reporting of refinance limit by banks.
c) Non-repayment of refinance within 180 days.
d) Delay in reporting excess utilisation by banks.
11. Documentation
11.1 The banks have to execute the following documents  for availing of export credit refinance facility (Annex II):

.
A Demand Promissory Note (DPN) in Form No.
DAD 295 A
.

The borrowing bank should  submit to Reserve Bank of India  a fortnightly declaration in form No.DAD.389 (Annex III) to enable the Reserve  Bank of India  to watch the position of the outstanding borrowings under the scheme in  relation to its outstanding export credit advances.
In terms of Para 7.30 of the Banking Department  Manual, Agreements and letters of extension of limit need not be renewed so  long as there is no change in the terms thereof. Promissory  notes given by the borrowing banks should, however, be renewed within three  years of their dates of execution notwithstanding  their outstandings in loan account.
12. Reporting Requirement
12.1 The availing banks are required to report  their outstanding export credit eligible for refinance within five days from  the relevant date in the format provided in Annex III.
13. Condition
13.1 It  is essential that the outstanding borrowings at all times are fully covered by  the borrowing banks’ holding of export bills/amount of eligible pre-shipment  advances as reported in their latest declaration. If at any time it is found that the total  amount of bills held by banks/amount of eligible pre-shipment advances covered  by the declaration fall below the amount borrowed, the banks should forthwith  adjust or repay excess refinance from the RBI.

Export Credit Refinance utilisation is  in excess of the limit allowed,
Refinance limits are calculated or  reported wrongly,
Drawals remain outstanding beyond 180  days on account of insufficient fund in our account
There  is long delay in reporting about the excess or irregular utilisation by us for  the period of delay.
(9) We also  agree that this agreement and said demand promissory note for Rs………… shall  operate as a continuing security for the said advance notwithstanding the  existence of a credit balance at any time or any partial payment or  fluctuations of accounts or withdrawal of any part of the security.
