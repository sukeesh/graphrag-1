Dear Sir,
Issue of Long Term Bonds by Banks – Financing of Infrastructure and  Affordable Housing
Please refer to our
circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.25/08.12.014/2014-15 dated July 15, 2014
on the captioned subject. In continuation of the same, banks are advised as  under:
2. In order to provide liquidity  to retail investors in such bonds, it has been decided that banks can extend  loans to individuals against long-term bonds issued by them under the  provisions of the above-mentioned circular. Boards of the banks should lay down  a policy in this regard prescribing suitable margins, purpose of the loan and  other safeguards. Further, such loans should be subject to a ceiling, say, Rs.10  lakh per borrower, and tenure of loan should be within the maturity period of  the bonds. It is also clarified that banks are not permitted to lend against  such bonds issued by other banks.
3. Further, in the formula for  ‘Eligible Credit (EC)’ as given in paragraph 7 of the above-mentioned circular dated July 15, 2014, ‘B’ (one of the two factors of EC) has been explained as Outstanding  ‘standard’ loans to Infrastructure sector (project loans) and affordable  housing
on the date of
issuance of the bonds
. On a review, it has been decided that ‘B’  should be read as Outstanding ‘standard’ loans to the Infrastructure  sector (project loans) and affordable housing
on the date of reporting to  RBI (reporting Fridays for reserve requirements and March 31 of a year for  computing priority sector obligation)
. Other instructions in this regard  remain unchanged.
Yours  faithfully,
(Sudarshan Sen)
