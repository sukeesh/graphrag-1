Please refer to para 4.5 ‘Transitional Arrangements’, para 15.2.2 of Part D ‘Capital Conservation Buffer Framework’ and para 2.3 of Annex 16 of the
Master Circular, DBR.No.BP.BC.1/21.06.201/2015-16 dated July 1, 2015
on ‘Basel III Capital Regulations’.
2. It has been decided to defer the implementation of the last tranche of 0.625% of Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) from March 31, 2019 to March 31, 2020. Accordingly, minimum capital conservation ratios in para 15.2.2 of Part D ‘Capital Conservation Buffer Framework’ as applicable from March 31, 2018 will also apply from March 31, 2019 till the CCB attains the level of 2.5% on March 31, 2020.
3. Further, the pre-specified trigger for loss absorption through conversion / write-down of Additional Tier 1 instruments (PNCPS and PDI) shall remain at 5.5% of RWAs and will rise to 6.125% of RWAs on March 31, 2020.
Yours faithfully
