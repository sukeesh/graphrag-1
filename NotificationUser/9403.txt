To
All Standalone  Primary Dealers
Dear  Sir/Madam,
Decrease  in Held to Maturity (HTM) limits for Standalone PDs
A  reference is invited to our
circular  IDMD.PDRD.No.828/03.64.00/2013-14 dated September 10, 2013
and para  10.6 of our
Master  Circular IDMD.PDRD.01/03.64.00/2014-15 dated July 01, 2014
on Operational  Guidelines to Primary Dealers regarding quantum of securities that can be classified as HTM.
2.Â  Taking into consideration prevailing market  conditions, the quantum of securities that can be classified as HTM is being  reduced from 200% to 100% of the audited NOF of the PD as at the end of the  preceding financial year. The new limits will come into effect from December 31,  2014. PDs are allowed to effect one additional transfer from HTM for the  current quarter ending December 31, 2014 to enable them to comply with the new  norms.
Yours  faithfully
(Rekha  Warriar)
