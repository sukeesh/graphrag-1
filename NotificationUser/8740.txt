advising Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) and State/Central Cooperative Banks (StCBs/CCBs) that the freedom to offer interest rates on incremental NRE deposits with maturity of 3 years and above without any ceiling in order to pass on the benefit of exemption provided on such deposits from CRR/ SLR requirements will remain valid up to January 31, 2014, subject to review.
