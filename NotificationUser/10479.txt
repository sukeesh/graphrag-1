Appendix
A) APPOINTMENT / DELISTING OF BROKERS
1. Procedure for enrollment / registration of brokers
Agency banks may follow a simple procedure for enrolment/registration of brokers. The broker seeking enrolment/registration may submit the request for registration on their business letterhead together with business data to the agency banks. The agency banks should allot a code number to the broker which should be quoted by the broker on all applications tendered at the Receiving offices for claiming brokerage.
2. Appointment of sub-agents by Agency banks
It has come to our notice that some banks designated/authorized by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have engaged the services of other banks as brokers/agents for receiving applications and the latter are using the name of RBI in their publicity material and billboards stating that RBI has appointed them as brokers for Relief/Savings bonds business. We advise that in cases where authorised banks engage the services of other banks/institutions as a broker or agent, the agency banks who have appointed them are solely responsible for their activities as an agent/broker. RBI's name should not be used by such banks.
3. Delisting of brokers
The names of the dormant brokers, who have been dormant for say 2 years, may be delisted after giving a due notice if, no fresh business is forthcoming from these brokers.
B) PAYMENT & RATES OF BROKERAGE FOR SAVINGS BONDS
1. Rates of brokerage
Brokerage at the rate of ₹ 1.00 (Rupee One only) per ₹ 100/- will be paid to brokers registered/enrolled with agency banks on applications tendered for investment in the bonds in the form of Bond Ledger Account (BLA) at designated branches on behalf of their clients and bearing their stamp.
No brokerage is payable in case the broker is one of the investors/applicants.
2. No TDS on payment of brokerage
No tax is required to be deducted at source by the agency banks while making payment of brokerage in respect of the Relief/Savings bonds business canvassed by brokers in terms of Section 194 (H) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
3. Brokerage claims
Agency banks are to settle the brokerage claims expeditiously, and in any case, not later than 30 days from the date of subscription.
Agency banks are advised to first settle the brokerage claims and thereafter seek reimbursement from RBI.
As a measure towards improvement in customer service, agency banks may arrange to pay the brokerage to the agents, on a monthly basis by credit to their accounts through ECS after obtaining requisite mandate from them.
Reimbursement of brokerage claims in respect of Relief/Savings bonds has been centralized at CAS Nagpur from July 01, 2002, and it has been decided that 90% of the brokerage due to agencies, on the basis of funds remitted/reported to CAS as at the close of business of the month, will be paid on the 3rd working day of the succeeding month. The balance 10% is to be settled on submission of Appendix IV statement.
C) NOMINATION FACILITY FOR RELIEF/SAVINGS BONDS
1. A sole holder or all the joint holders (investors) of a Relief/Savings bond other than in the form of promissory note or bearer bond may nominate one or more persons who in the event of death of the sole holder/all the joint holders, as the case may be, would be entitled to the Relief/Savings bond and to the payment thereon, provided that the person or each of the persons nominated is himself/herself competent to hold a similar bond.
2. The nomination should be made before maturity of the bond.
3. When nomination has been made in favour of two or more nominees, in the event of the death of either or any of them, the surviving nominee or nominees, as the case may be, shall be entitled to the Relief/Savings bond and payment thereon.
4. A nomination made by the holder(s) of a Relief/Savings bond may be varied or cancelled by making a fresh nomination in the prescribed manner and intimating the same in writing to the designated branch of the authorised public/private sector bank.

6. The investor(s) can make separate nomination for each investment in a Bond Ledger Account (BLA) (subject to 2 above).
7. Agency banks to issue ‘Acknowledgement of Nomination.'
