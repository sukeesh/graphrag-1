Dear Sir/Madam
Basel III Framework on Liquidity Standards - Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR),
FALLCR against credit disbursed to NBFCs and HFCs
Please refer to our
DBR.BP.BC.No.34/21.04.098/2018-19 dated April 4, 2019
wherein banks have been permitted to reckon, in a phased manner, an additional 2 per cent of government securities held by them under Facility to Avail Liquidity for Liquidity Coverage Ratio (FALLCR) within the mandatory SLR requirement, as Level 1 HQLA for the purpose of computing Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR).
2. As per the roadmap, FALLCR is scheduled to increase by 0.50 per cent of NDTL on August 1 and December 1, 2019, respectively. It has been decided that, with immediate effect, banks will be permitted to reckon this increase in FALLCR of 1.0 per cent of the bankâ€™s NDTL as Level 1 HQLA for computing LCR, to the extent of incremental outstanding credit to NBFCs and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) over and above the amount of credit to NBFCs/HFCs outstanding on their books as on date. The frontloading of FALLCR of one per cent, exclusively meant for incremental exposure to NBFCs/HFCs, will form part of general FALLCR as and when the increase in FALLCR takes place as per original schedule on August 1 and December 1, 2019.
3. All other instructions as per our circular ibid remain unchanged.
Yours faithfully,
(Saurav Sinha)
