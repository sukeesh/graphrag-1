Annex-1
‘Fit and Proper’ Criteria for directors of NBFCs
Reserve Bank had issued a Directive in June 2004 to banks on undertaking due diligence on the persons before appointing them on the Boards of banks based on the ‘Report of the Consultative Group of directors of Banks / Financial Institutions’. Specific ‘fit and proper’ criteria to be fulfilled by the directors were also advised.
2. The importance of due diligence of directors to ascertain suitability for the post by way of qualifications, technical expertise, track record, integrity, etc. needs no emphasis for any financial institution. It is proposed to follow the same guidelines mutatis mutandis in case of NBFCs also. While the Reserve Bank does carry out due diligence on directors before issuing Certificate of Registration to an NBFC, it is necessary that NBFCs put in place an internal supervisory process on a continuing basis. Further, in order to streamline and bring in uniformity in the process of due diligence, while appointing directors, NBFCs are advised to ensure that the procedures mentioned below are followed and minimum criteria fulfilled by the persons before they are appointed on the Boards:
(a) NBFCs should undertake a process of due diligence to determine the suitability of the person for appointment / continuing to hold appointment as a director on the Board, based upon qualification, expertise, track record, integrity and other ‘fit and proper’ criteria. NBFCs should obtain necessary information and declaration from the proposed / existing directors for the purpose in the format given at
Annex- 2
.
(b) The process of due diligence should be undertaken by the NBFCs at the time of appointment / renewal of appointment.
(c) The boards of the NBFCs should constitute Nomination Committees to scrutinize the declarations.
(d) Based on the information provided in the signed declaration, Nomination Committees should decide on the acceptance or otherwise of the directors, where considered necessary.
(e) NBFCs should obtain annually as on 31st March a simple declaration from the directors that the information already provided has not undergone change and where there is any change, requisite details are furnished by them forthwith.
(f) The Board of the NBFC must ensure in public interest that the nominated/ elected directors execute the deeds of covenants in the format given in
Annex-3
.

a)  For determining the amount of unsecured advances the rights, licenses, authorisations, etc., charged to the NBFCs as collateral in respect of projects (including infrastructure projects) financed by them, should not be reckoned as tangible security. Hence such advances shall be reckoned as unsecured.
b)  NBFCs should also disclose the total amount of advances for which intangible securities such as charge over the rights, licenses, authority, etc. has been taken as also the estimated value of such intangible collateral. The disclosure may be made under a separate head in NTA. This would differentiate such loans from other entirely unsecured loans.

4.7 Net Profit or Loss for the period, prior period items and changes in accounting policies

An enterprise should also disclose the circumstances in which revenue recognition has been postponed pending the resolution of significant uncertainties.
4.9 Accounting Standard 21 -Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS)
NBFCs may be guided by general clarifications issued by ICAI from time to time.
A parent company, presenting the CFS, should consolidate the financial statements of all subsidiaries - domestic as well as foreign. The reasons for not consolidating a subsidiary should be disclosed in the CFS. The responsibility of determining whether a particular entity should be included or not for consolidation would be that of the Management of the parent entity.
