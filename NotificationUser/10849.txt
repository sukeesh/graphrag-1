An announcement to this effect was made in the
Monetary Policy Statement on April 5, 2016
.
3. NRIs may access the ETCD market as per the following terms and conditions:
NRIs shall designate an AD Cat-I bank for the purpose of monitoring and reporting their combined positions in the OTC and ETCD segments.
NRIs may take positions in the currency futures / exchange traded options market to hedge the currency risk on the market value of their permissible (under FEMA, 1999) Rupee investments in debt and equity and dividend due and balances held in NRE accounts.
The exchange/ clearing corporation will provide details of all transactions of the NRI to the designated bank.
The designated bank will consolidate the positions of the NRI on the exchanges as well as the OTC derivative contracts booked with them and with other AD banks. The designated bank shall monitor the aggregate positions and ensure the existence of underlying Rupee currency risk and bring transgressions, if any, to the notice of RBI / SEBI.
The onus of ensuring the existence of the underlying exposure shall rest with the NRI concerned. If the magnitude of exposure through the hedge transactions exceeds the magnitude of underlying exposure, the concerned NRI shall be liable to such penal action as may be taken by Reserve Bank of India under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999.
