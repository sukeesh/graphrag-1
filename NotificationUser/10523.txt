The Government of India has enacted the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 and notified the same vide Gazette Notification dated June 16, 2006. With the enactment of MSMED Act 2006, the paradigm shift that has taken place is the inclusion of the services sector in the definition of Micro, Small & Medium enterprises, apart from extending the scope to medium enterprises. The MSMED Act, 2006 has modified the definition of micro, small and medium enterprises engaged in manufacturing or production and providing or rendering of services. The Reserve Bank has notified the changes to all scheduled commercial banks. Further, the definition, as per the Act, has been adopted for purposes of bank credit vide RBI
circular ref. RPCD.PLNFS. BC.No.63/ 06.02.31/ 2006-07 dated April 4, 2007
.
2.1 Definition of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises

Banks may, on the basis of good track record and financial position of the MSE units, increase the limit to dispense with the collateral requirement for loans up to Rs.25 lakh (with the approval of the appropriate authority).
Banks are advised to strongly encourage their branch level functionaries to avail of the Credit Guarantee Scheme cover, including making performance in this regard a criterion in the evaluation of their field staff.
4.3 Composite loan
A composite loan limit of Rs.1 crore can be sanctioned by banks to enable the MSE entrepreneurs to avail of their working capital and term loan requirement through Single Window.
4.4 Revised General Credit Card (GCC) Scheme
In order to enhance the coverage of GCC Scheme to ensure greater credit linkage for all productive activities within the overall Priority Sector guidelines and to capture all credit extended by banks to individuals for non-farm entrepreneurial activity, the GCC guidelines were revised on December 2, 2013.
4.5 Credit Linked Capital Subsidy Scheme (CLSS)
Government of India, Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises had launched Credit Linked Capital Subsidy Scheme (CLSS) for Technology Upgradation of Micro and Small Enterprises subject to the following terms and conditions:

4.6 Streamlining flow of credit to Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) for facilitating timely and adequate credit flow during their ‘Life Cycle’:
In order to provide timely financial support to Micro and Small enterprises facing financial difficulties during their ‘Life Cycle’, guidelines were issued to banks vide our
circular FIDD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.60/06.02.31/2015-16 dated August 27, 2015
on the captioned subject. Banks are advised to review and tune their existing lending policies to the MSE sector by incorporating therein the following provisions so as to facilitate timely and adequate availability of credit to viable MSE borrowers especially during the need of funds in unforeseen circumstances:
i) To extend standby credit facility in case of term loans
ii) Additional working capital to meet with emergent needs of MSE units
iii) Mid-term review of the regular working capital limits, where banks are convinced that changes in the demand pattern of MSE borrowers require increasing the existing credit limits of the MSMEs, every year based on the actual sales of the previous year.
iv) Timelines for Credit Decisions
4.7 Debt Restructuring Mechanism for MSMEs
(i) All scheduled commercial banks are advised to follow the guidelines / instructions pertaining to SME Debt Restructuring, as contained in
circular DBR.No.BP.BC.2/21.04.048/2015-16 dated July 1, 2015
on ‘Master Circular - Prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances’ and as updated from time to time.
(ii) In the light of the recommendations of the Working Group on Rehabilitation of Sick MSEs (Chairman: Dr. K.C. Chakrabarty), all commercial banks are advised vide our
circular RPCD. SME &NFS.BC.No.102/06.04.01/2008-09 dated May 4, 2009
to:
(a) put in place loan policies governing extension of credit facilities, Restructuring/Rehabilitation policy for revival of potentially viable sick units / enterprises (now read with guidelines on Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises issued on March 17, 2016) and non- discretionary One Time Settlement scheme for recovery of non-performing loans for the MSE sector, with the approval of the Board of Directors and
(b) implement recommendations with regard to timely and adequate flow of credit to the MSE sector.
(iii) Banks are advised to give wide publicity to the One Time settlement scheme implemented by them, by placing it on the bank’s website and through other possible modes of dissemination. They may allow reasonable time to the borrowers to submit the application and also make payment of the dues in order to extend the benefits of the scheme to eligible borrowers.
4.8 Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of MSMEs
The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Government of India, vide their Gazette Notification dated May 29, 2015 had notified a ‘Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises’ to provide a simpler and faster mechanism to address the stress in the accounts of MSMEs and to facilitate the promotion and development of MSMEs. The Reserve Bank was advised to issue necessary instructions to banks for effective implementation and monitoring of the said Framework. After carrying out certain changes in the captioned Framework in consultation with the Government of India, Ministry of MSME so as to make it compatible with the existing regulatory guidelines on ‘Income Recognition, Asset Classification and provisioning pertaining to Advances’ issued to banks by RBI, the guidelines on the captioned Framework along with operating instructions were issued to banks on March 17, 2016. The revival and rehabilitation of MSME units having loan limits up to Rs.25 crore would be undertaken under this Framework. Banks were required to put in place their own Board approved policy to operationalize the Framework not later than June 30, 2016. The revised Framework supersedes our earlier Guidelines on Rehabilitation of Sick Micro and Small Enterprises issued vide our
circular RPCD. CO. MSME & NFS.BC.40/06.02.31/2012-2013 dated November 1, 2012
, except those relating to Reliefs and Concessions for Rehabilitation of Potentially Viable Units and One Time Settlement, mentioned in the said circular.
The salient features of the Framework are as under:
i) Before a loan account of an MSME turns into a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), banks or creditors should identify incipient stress in the account by creating three sub-categories under the Special Mention Account (SMA) category as given in the Framework
ii) Any MSME borrower may also voluntarily initiate proceedings under this Framework
iii) Committee approach to be adopted for deciding corrective action plan
iv) Time lines have been fixed for taking various decisions under the Framework
4.9 Structured Mechanism for monitoring the credit growth to the MSE sector
In view of the concerns emerging from the deceleration in credit growth to the MSE sector, an Indian Banking Association (IBA)-led Sub-Committee (Chairman: Shri K.R. Kamath) was set up to suggest a structured mechanism to be put in place by banks to monitor the entire gamut of credit related issues pertaining to the sector. Based on the recommendations of the Committee, banks are advised to:
strengthen their existing systems of monitoring credit growth to the sector and put in place a system-driven comprehensive performance management information system (MIS) at every supervisory level (branch, region, zone, head office) which should be critically evaluated on a regular basis;
put in place a system of e-tracking of MSE loan applications and monitor the loan application disposal process in banks, giving branch-wise, region-wise, zone-wise and State-wise positions. The position in this regard is to be displayed by banks on their websites; and
monitor timely rehabilitation of sick MSE units. The progress in rehabilitation of sick MSE units is to be made available on the website of banks.
Detailed guidelines were issued to the scheduled commercial banks vide our
circular RPCD. MSME&NFS.BC.No.74/06.02.31/2012-13 dated May 9, 2013
.
Chapter - V
5 Institutional arrangements
5.1 Specialised MSME branches
Public sector banks are advised to open at least one specialised branch in each district. Further, banks have been permitted to categorise their general banking branches having 60% or more of their advances to MSME sector as specialized MSME branches in order to encourage them to open more specialised MSME branches for providing better service to this sector as a whole. As per the policy package announced by the Government of India for stepping up credit to MSME sector, the public sector banks would ensure specialized MSME branches in identified clusters/centres with preponderance of small enterprises to enable the entrepreneurs to have easy access to the bank credit and to equip bank personnel to develop requisite expertise. The existing specialised SSI branches, if any, may also be redesignated as MSME branches. Though their core competence will be utilized for extending finance and other services to MSME sector, they will have operational flexibility to extend finance/render other services to other sectors/borrowers. Banks may take care to train the officials posted in such branches appropriately.
5.2 State Level Inter Institutional Committee (SLIIC)
In order to deal with the problems of co-ordination for rehabilitation of sick micro and small units, State Level Inter-Institutional Committees were set up in the States. However, the matter of continuation or otherwise, of the SLIIC Forum has been left to the individual States / Union Territory. The meetings of these Committees are convened by Regional Offices of RBI and presided over by the Secretary, MSME or Industry of the concerned State Government. It provides a useful forum for adequate interfacing between the State Government Officials and State Level Institutions on the one side and the term lending institutions and banks on the other. It closely monitors timely sanction of working capital to units which have been provided term loans by SFCs, implementation of special schemes such as Margin Money Scheme of State Government and reviews general problems faced by industries and sickness in MSE sector based on the data furnished by banks. Among others, the representatives of the local state level MSE associations are invited to the meetings of SLIIC which are held quarterly.
5.3 Empowered Committee on MSMEs
As part of the announcement made by the Union Finance Minister, at the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India, Empowered Committees on MSMEs are constituted under the Chairmanship of the Regional Directors with the representatives of SLBC Convenor, senior level officers from two banks having predominant share in MSME financing in the state, representative of SIDBI Regional Office, the Director of MSME or Industries of the State Government, one or two senior level representatives from the MSME Associations in the state, and a senior level officer from SFC/SIDC as members. The Committee would meet periodically and review the progress in MSME financing as also rehabilitation of sick Micro, Small and Medium units. It would also coordinate with other banks/financial institutions and the state government in removing bottlenecks, if any, to ensure smooth flow of credit to the sector. The committees may decide the need to have similar committees at cluster/district levels.
5.4 Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI)
The Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) has formulated a Code of Bank's Commitment to Micro and Small Enterprises. This is a voluntary Code, which sets minimum standards of banking practices for banks to follow when they are dealing with Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) as defined in the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006. It provides protection to MSE and explains how banks are expected to deal with MSE for their day to-day operations and in times of financial difficulty.
The Code also mentions, inter alia, that the banks are expected to dispose of MSE loan application for a credit limit or enhancement in the existing credit limit up to Rs.5 lakh within two weeks; and for credit limit above Rs.5 lakh and up to Rs.25 lakh within 3 weeks; and for credit limit above Rs.25 lakh within 6 weeks from the date of receipt, provided the application is complete in all respects and is accompanied by documents as per ‘check list’ provided.
While banks may voluntarily adhere to such time limits in the Code, every effort should be taken to reduce further the time taken to process and dispose of MSE loan applications.
The Code does not replace or supersede regulatory or supervisory instructions issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and banks will comply with such instructions /directions issued by the RBI from time to time.
5.4.1 Objectives of the BCSBI Code
The Code is developed to:
(a) Give a positive thrust to the MSE sector by providing easy access to efficient banking services.
(b) Promote good and fair banking practices by setting minimum standards in dealing with MSE.
(c) Increase transparency so that a better understanding of what can reasonably be expected of the services.
(d) Improve understanding of business through effective communication.
(e) Encourage market forces, through competition, to achieve higher operating standards.
(f) Promote a fair and cordial relationship between MSE and banks and also ensure timely and quick response to banking needs.
(g) Foster confidence in the banking system.
The complete text of the Code is available at the BCSBI's website (
www.bcsbi.org.in
)
5.5 Micro and Small Enterprises Sector – The imperative of Financial Literacy and consultancy support
Keeping in view the high extent of financial exclusion in the MSME sector, it is imperative for banks that the excluded units are brought within the fold of the formal banking sector. The lack of financial literacy, operational skills, including accounting and finance, business planning etc. represent formidable challenge for MSE borrowers underscoring the need for facilitation by banks in these critical financial areas. Moreover, MSE enterprises are further handicapped in this regard by absence of scale and size. To effectively and decisively address these handicaps, Scheduled commercial banks were advised vide our
circular RPCD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.20/06.02.31/2012-13 dated August 1, 2012
that they could either separately set up special cells at their branches, or vertically integrate this function in the Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs) set up by them, as per their comparative advantage. The bank staff should also be trained through customised training programs to meet the specific needs of the sector.
5.6 Cluster Approach
All SLBC Convenor banks are advised to incorporate in their Annual Credit Plans, the credit requirement in the clusters identified by the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Government of India. They are also encouraged to extend banking services in such clusters / agglomerations which have come up and identified subsequently by SLBC / DCC members.
(i) As per Ganguly Committee recommendations (September 4, 2004), banks are advised that a full-service approach to cater to the diverse needs of the SSI sector (now MSE sector) may be achieved through extending banking services to recognized MSE clusters by adopting a 4-C approach namely, Customer focus, Cost control, Cross sell and Contain risk. A cluster based approach to lending may be more beneficial:
(a) in dealing with well-defined and recognized groups;
(b) availability of appropriate information for risk assessment and
(c) monitoring by the lending institutions.
Clusters may be identified based on factors such as trade record, competitiveness and growth prospects and/or other cluster specific data.
(ii) All SLBC Convenor banks were advised vide letter RPCD.PLNFS.No.10416/06.02.31/ 2006-07 dated May 8, 2007 to review their institutional arrangements for delivering credit to the MSME sector, especially in 388 clusters identified by United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) spread over 21 states in various parts of the country. A list of SME clusters as identified by UNIDO has been furnished in
Annex II
.
(iii) The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises has approved a list of clusters under the Scheme of Fund for Regeneration of Traditional Industries (SFURTI) and Micro and Small Enterprises Cluster Development Programme (MSE-CDP) located in 121 Minority Concentration Districts. Accordingly, appropriate measures have been taken to improve the credit flow to the identified clusters of micro and small entrepreneurs from the Minority Communities residing in the minority concentrated districts of the country.
(iv) In terms of recommendations of the Prime Minister’s Task Force on MSMEs banks should open more MSE focused branch offices at different MSE clusters which can also act as Counselling Centres for MSEs. Each lead bank of a district may adopt at least one MSE cluster.
5.7 Delayed Payment
In the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED), Act 2006, the provisions of the Interest on Delayed Payment Act, 1998 to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings, have been strengthened as under:
(i) The buyer has to make payment to the supplier on or before the date agreed upon between him and the supplier in writing or, in case of no agreement, before the appointed day. The period agreed upon between the supplier and the buyer shall not exceed forty five days from the date of acceptance or the day of deemed acceptance.
(ii) In case the buyer fails to make payment of the amount to the supplier, he shall be liable to pay compound interest with monthly rests to the supplier on the amount from the appointed day or, on the date agreed on, at three times of the Bank Rate notified by Reserve Bank.
(iii) For any goods supplied or services rendered by the supplier, the buyer shall be liable to pay the interest as advised at (ii) above.
(iv) In case of dispute with regard to any amount due, a reference shall be made to the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council, constituted by the respective State Government.
Further, banks are advised to fix sub-limits within the overall working capital limits to the large borrowers specifically for meeting the payment obligation in respect of purchases from MSMEs.
CHAPTER - VI
