and
DBR.DEA Fund Cell.BC.No.110/30.01.002/2017-18 dated June 07, 2018
wherein RBI had specified the rates of interest payable by banks to the depositors on the unclaimed interest bearing deposit amount transferred to the DEA Fund.
2. The rate of interest has since been reviewed and it has been decided that the rate of interest payable by banks to the depositors/claimants on the unclaimed interest bearing deposit amount transferred to the Fund shall be 3 per cent simple interest per annum with effect from the date of this circular.

July 1, 2018 up to May 10, 2021 and at 3 per cent with effect from May 11, 2021 till the time of payment to the depositor/claimant.
