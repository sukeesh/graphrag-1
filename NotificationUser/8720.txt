The Chairmen / CEOs of
All Regional Rural Banks /
State and Central Co-operative Banks
Dear Sir/Madam,
Collection  of Account Payee Cheques –
Prohibition  on Crediting Proceeds to Third Party Account
Please refer to our  circulars
RPCD.CO.RRB.BC.No.30/03.05.33/2011-12 dated November 11, 2011
and
RPCD.CO.RCBD.BC.No.34/07.38.03/2011-12 dated November 24, 2011
advising Regional  Rural Banks (RRBs) and State / Central Cooperative Banks (StCBs/CCBs) that they  are prohibited from crediting 'account payee' cheques to the account of any  person other than the payee named therein. We reiterate these instructions and  advise that banks should strictly collect ‘account payee’ cheques only for  their payee constituents.
2. RRBs and StCBs/CCBs may, however, consider collecting  account payee cheques drawn for an amount not exceeding Rs.50,000/- to the  account of their customers who are co-operative credit societies, if the payees  of such cheques are the constituents of such co-operative credit societies, as  advised in our above circulars dated November 11, 2011 and November 24, 2011.
Yours  faithfully,
(A. Udgata)
Principal Chief General  Manager
