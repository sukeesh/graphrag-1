1. Introduction
All financial Institutions, whether statutory bodies or limited companies, are subject to RBI regulations since 1998. FIs play an important role in the financial markets and facilitate fund raising resource allocation etc. Initially, the RBI had prescribed instrument-wise limits for mobilisation of resources by the select FIs through the specified instruments. In May 1997, the instrument-wise ceilings were replaced by an “umbrella limit” linked to the ‘net owned funds’ of the FI concerned, which constituted the overall ceiling for borrowing by the FI through the specified instruments. The system of umbrella limit remains in force even now though a few additional instruments have been included under the limit, over the years.
2. Norms for Resource Raising under the 'Umbrella Limit'
The ‘umbrella limit’ at present consists of five instruments viz., term deposits, term money borrowings, certificates of deposits (CDs), commercial papers (CPs) and inter-corporate deposits (ICDs). The aggregate borrowings through these specified instruments should not at any time exceed 100 per cent of net owned funds (NOF) of the FI concerned as per its latest audited balance sheet or as approved by RBI for individual financial institutions. The terms and conditions relating to each of the instruments are set out below.
2.1 Term Deposits
Item
Instructions
Aggregate Amount
An FI may accept term deposits within the overall umbrella limit fixed by RBI, i.e., term deposits along with other instruments viz. term money, CPs, CDs and inter corporate deposits should not exceed 100% of its net owned funds, as per the latest audited balance sheet.
Maturity Period
1 to 5 years.
Interest Rates
FIs are free to fix the interest rates.
Minimum Size
Rs.10,000/-
Brokerage
1% of the deposits accepted.
Premature Withdrawal
i)
In the case of premature withdrawal before completion of one year due to death of depositor, medical exigencies, educational expenditure and other such reasons, the following norm should be applied :
(a)
Premature withdrawal before six months -no interest to be paid
(b)
Premature withdrawal between six months and one year -interest to be paid at the rate of 4.0 per cent.
(ii)
Beyond 1 year, FIs have freedom to fix their own penal rate of interest on premature withdrawal of deposits
Rating
Rating from the rating agencies approved by the SEBI is mandatory.
Other terms and conditions
FIs should not provide any loan against the term deposits accepted.
2.2 Term Money Borrowings
Item
Instructions
Aggregate Amount
An FI may raise term money within the overall umbrella limit fixed by RBI i.e., term money borrowings along with other instruments, viz., term deposits, CPs, CDs and inter corporate deposits should not exceed 100% of its net owned funds, as per the latest audited balance sheet.
Maturity Period
Not less than 3 months and not exceeding 6 months.
Interest Rates
FIs are free to fix interest rates.
Borrowings from
FIs are eligible to borrow 'term money' from Scheduled Commercial Banks and Co-operative banks only.
2.3 Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
Item
Instructions
Eligibility
CDs can be issued by select all-India Financial Institutions that have been permitted by the RBI to raise short-term resources within the umbrella limit fixed by the RBI.
Aggregate Amount
An FI may issue CDs within the overall umbrella limit fixed by the RBI, i.e., issue of CDs together with other instruments viz., term money, term deposits, CPs and inter corporate deposits should not exceed 100% of its net owned funds, as per the latest audited balance sheet.
Denomination
Minimum amount of a CD should be Rs.1 lakh i.e., the minimum deposit that can be accepted from a single subscriber should not be less than Rs.1 lakh. CD issued will be in multiples of Rs.1 lakh.
Who can subscribe?
CDs can be issued to individuals (other than minors), corporations, companies, trusts, funds, associations, etc. Non Resident Indians may also subscribe to CDs, but only on non-repatriable basis which should be clearly stated on the Certificate. Such CDs cannot be endorsed to another NRI in the secondary market.
Maturity
FIs can issue CDs for a period not less than 1 year and not exceeding 3 years from the date of issue.
Discount / Coupon Rate
- Fixed & Floating
CDs may be issued at a discount on face value but may also be issued as coupon bearing instruments. FIs are also allowed to issue CDs on floating rate basis provided the methodology of compiling the floating rate is objective, transparent and market based.
FIs are free to determine the discount / coupon rate.
Format
FIs should issue CDs only in dematerialised form. However, according to the Depositories Act, 1996, investors have the option to seek certificate in physical form. Accordingly, if an investor insists on physical certificate, the FI may inform the Chief General Manager, Financial Markets Regulation Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001 about such instances separately. Further, issuance of CDs will attract stamp duty. A format in Annex I (
Schedule I
) is enclosed for adoption by banks / FIs. There will be no grace period for repayment of CDs. If the maturity date happens to be a holiday, the issuing FI should make payment on the immediate preceding working day. FIs, therefore, should fix the period of deposit in such a manner that the maturity date does not coincide with a holiday to avoid loss of discount / interest rate.
Transferability
Physical CDs are freely transferable by endorsement and delivery. Dematted CDs can be transferred as per the procedure applicable to other demat securities. There is no lock-in period for the CDs.
Loans / Buybacks
FIs cannot sanction loans against CDs nor can they buy back their own CDs before maturity.
Standardised Market
Practices and Documentation
FIs should refer to the detailed guidelines issued by Fixed Income
Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) in this regard on June 20, 2002 as amended from time to time.
