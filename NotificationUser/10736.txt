Dear Sir / Madam,
Special knowledge or practical experience useful to banking companies
In the backdrop of innovations in banking and technology, it is felt that the domain knowledge and experience enumerated under various statutory provisions for the directors on the boards of commercial banks (excluding RRBs) need to be augmented by knowledge and experience in other specialized areas, to guide the banks in managing their diversified business portfolios and risks. It has, therefore, been decided to broaden the fields of specialization to include (i) Information Technology (ii) Payment & Settlement Systems (iii) Human Resources (iv) Risk Management and (v) Business Management, for persons who could be considered for appointment of director in the banks.
2. A copy of the relative notification DBR.Appt.BC.No.38/29.39.001/2016-17 dated November 24, 2016, is

Yours faithfully,
