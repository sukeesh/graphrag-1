All  the entities authorised under PSS Act, 2007
Dear  Madam/ Sir,
Computation of Net-worth
As you are aware, under the Payment and Settlement Systems  Act, 2007 (PSS Act) an entity operating a payment system within the country has  to obtain authorisation from the Reserve Bank of India. The Reserve Bank has from  time to time issued guidelines in respect of the eligibility criteria for  authorisation of Payment System Operators, including PPI issuers, overseas  principals for Money Transfer Service Scheme, card network operators, etc.  These entities have to inter alia, comply with the requirements of minimum  paid-up capital and net-worth, as applicable.
2. In order to have  uniformity and clarity in respect of the computation of net-worth for an entity  authorised under the PSS Act, it is advised that ‘
Net-worth’
will  consist of ‘
paid up equity capital, free reserves, balance in share premium  account and capital reserves representing surplus arising out of sale proceeds  of assets but not reserves created by revaluation of assets’
adjusted for ‘
accumulated  loss balance, book value of intangible assets and Deferred Revenue Expenditure,  if any’
. This definition would apply for the purpose of all approvals under  the PSS Act.
Yours  faithfully,
(Nanda S. Dave)
Chief General Manager
