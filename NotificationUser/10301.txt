Madam/ Sir,
Review of risk weights assigned to sovereign debt
In terms of the extant directions, deposit accepting NBFCs, systemically important non-deposit taking NBFCs, all NBFC-MFIs and all NBFC-IFCs shall maintain a minimum capital ratio consisting of Tier I and Tier II capital which shall not be less than 15 per cent of its aggregate risk weighted assets on-balance sheet and of risk adjusted value of off-balance sheet items.
2. Based on the representations received from the industry, the risk weights assigned to exposures to domestic sovereigns have been reviewed. It has been decided as under:
A) Exposures to Central Government
fund based and non-fund based claims on the Central Government will attract a zero risk weight.
Central Government guaranteed claims will attract a zero risk weight.
B) Exposures to State Government
Direct loan/ credit/ overdraft exposure and investment in State Government securities will attract zero risk weight.
State Government guaranteed claims, which have not remained in default, will attract 20 per cent risk weight. However, if the loans guaranteed by the State Government have remained in default for a period of more than 90 days, a risk weight of 100% should be assigned.
