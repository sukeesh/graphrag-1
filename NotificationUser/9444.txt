Dear Sir/Madam,
Roadmap-Provision of Banking Services in Villages with Population below 2000
You are aware that the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) was launched by the Honâ€™ble Prime Minister on 28th August, 2014 and Phase I of PMJDY is being implemented through banks in a time bound manner for completion by August 14, 2015.
2. In this connection, attention is invited to
circular RPCD.CO.LBS.BC.No. 86/02.01.001/2011-12 dated June 19, 2012
wherein SLBCs were advised to prepare a roadmap and cover all unbanked villages with population less than 2000 for providing banking services in a time-bound manner (latest by March 2016).
3. Keeping in view the ongoing implementation of PMJDY, SLBC Convenors banks and lead banks are advised to complete the process of providing banking services in unbanked villages with population below 2000 by August 14, 2015 in line with the PMJDY instead of March 2016 prescribed earlier.
Yours faithfully,
(T V Rao)
Deputy General Manager
