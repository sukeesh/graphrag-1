Madam/Dear Sir,
Implementation of Section 51-A of UAPA, 1967- UNSCR 1267(1999) / 1989(2011) Committee's Al Qaida  Sanctions List and UNSCR 1988(2011) Taliban Sanctions List – Modification in  the Listing Format
A reference is invited to our circulars issued  from time to time advising about amendments/ additions/ deletions to UNSCR  1267(1999) / 1989(2011) Al Qaida Sanction List and UNSCR 1988(2011)  Taliban Sanctions List.
2.  Government of India (GoI), Ministry of  External Affairs (MEA) has now advised that the United Nations Sanction Committee has  adopted a new listing format which is designed for all Sanctions Committees.  The key modification in the new list is a newer permanent referencing system  that is harmonized with all other United Nations Sanction Lists.
3. The new version of the List is available at
http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/aq_sanctions_list_new.shtml
and a detailed explanation  of how the referencing system has been changed has been given at
http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/changes_newlist_format.shtml

4.  MEA has further informed that with effect from March 1, 2015, the Al-Qaida/Taliban  Sanctions list prepared based on the previous format will no longer be  available on the Committee's web site and will be replaced by the modified new  version as referred above. The new lists and the consolidated UNSC Sanctions  List, will continue to be available at:

http://www.un.org/sc/committees/1988/list_new.shtml

MEA  has also suggested that new format be referred while making reference to any  individual or entity on the sanction list.
