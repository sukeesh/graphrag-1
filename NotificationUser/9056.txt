C.3.1. EDF Form (Erstwhile GR and PP Form)
(i) The EDF will replace the existing GR form used for declaration of export of Goods at Non-EDI ports. The procedure relating to the exports of goods through EDI ports will remain the same. However, the requirement of declaring the exports of goods / software in the SDF in case of exports taking place through the EDI ports has been dispensed with as the mandatory statutory requirements contained in the erstwhile SDF have been subsumed in the Shipping Bill format.
(ii) EDF forms should be completed by the exporter in duplicate and both the copies submitted to the Customs at the port of shipment along with the shipping bill.
(iii) Customs will give their running serial number on both the copies after admitting the corresponding shipping bill. The Customs serial number will have ten numerals denoting the code number of the port of shipment, the calendar year and a six- digit running serial number.
(iv) Customs will certify the value declared by the exporter on both the copies of the EDF form at the space earmarked and will also record the assessed value.
(v) They will then return the duplicate copy of the form to the exporter and retain the original for transmission to the Reserve Bank.
(vi) Exporters should submit the duplicate copy of the EDF form again to Customs along with the cargo to be shipped.
(vii) After examination of the goods and certifying the quantity passed for shipment on the duplicate copy, Customs will return it to the exporter for submission to the AD Category – I banks for negotiation or collection of export bills.
(viii) Within 21 days from the date of export, exporter should lodge the duplicate copy together with relative shipping documents and an extra copy of the invoice with the AD Category – I banks named in the EDF form.

(Erstwhile PP Form)
(xiii) Postal Authorities will allow export of goods by post only if the original copy of the form has been countersigned by an AD Category – I bank. Therefore, EDF forms which involve sending goods by post should be first presented by the exporter to an AD Category – I bank for countersignature. The procedure is as under:
(a) The AD Category – I banks will countersign the forms after ensuring that the parcel is being addressed to their branch or correspondent bank in the country of import and return the original copy to the exporter, who should submit the form to the post office with the parcel.
(b) The duplicate copy of the EDF form will be retained by the AD banks to whom the exporter should submit relevant documents together with an extra copy of invoice for negotiation/collection, within the prescribed period of 21 days.
(c) The concerned overseas branch or correspondent should be instructed to deliver the parcel to consignee against payment or acceptance of relative bill.
(d) AD Category – I banks may, however, countersign EDF forms covering parcels addressed direct to the consignees, provided:
(e) An irrevocable letter of credit for the full value of the export has been opened in favour of the exporter and has been advised through the AD Category – I banks concerned.
Or
The full value of the shipment has been received in advance by the exporter through an AD Category – I banks.
Or
The AD Category – I bank is satisfied, on the basis of the standing and track record of the exporter and the arrangements made for realization of the export proceeds, that he could do so.
(f) In such cases, particulars of advance payment/letter of credit / AD Category – I bank’s certification of standing, etc., of the exporter should be furnished on the form under proper authentication.
(g) Any alteration in the name and address of consignee on the EDF form should also be authenticated by the AD Category – I banks under his stamp and signature.
C.3.2. Mid-Sea Trans-shipment of catch by Deep Sea Fishing Vessels
(i) Since deep sea fishing involves continuous sailing outside the territorial limit, trans-shipment of catches takes place in the high sea leading to procedural constraints in regulatory reporting requirement viz. the Declaration of Export in terms of Notification No.FEMA.23/2000/RB dated May 3, 2000.
(ii) For mid-sea trans-shipment of catches by Indian owned vessels, as per the norms prescribed by the Ministry of agriculture, Government of India, the EDF declaration procedure in this regard has been rationalized in consultation with the Government of India as outlined below should be followed by the exporter in conformity with Regulation 3 of Notification No.FEMA.23/2000-RB dated May 3, 2000.

(f) The EDF, both original and duplicate, should indicate the number and date of Letter of Permit issued by Ministry of Agriculture for operation of the vessel.
(g) The exporter will complete the EDF in duplicate and both the copies may be submitted to the Customs at the registered port of the vessel or any other port as approved by Ministry of Agriculture. EDF (Original) will be retained by the Customs for capturing of data in Customs’ Electronic Data Interchange.
(h) Customs will give their running serial number on both the copies of EDF and will return the duplicate copy to the exporter as the value certification of the export has already been done as mentioned above.
(i) Rules, Regulations and Directions issued in respect of the procedure for submission of the EDF by exporter to the AD Category-I banks, and the disposal of these forms by these banks will be same as applicable to the other exporters.
C.4 In case of export of goods / software done through EDI ports
(i) The relative shipping bill  should be submitted in duplicate to the Commissioner of Customs concerned.

In such cases, ECGC and private insurance companies regulated by IRDA will issue a certificate to the bank, which had handled the relevant shipping documents after full proceeds have been received. The certificate will indicate the number of declaration form, name of the exporter, name of the AD Category – I banks, date of negotiation, bill number, invoice value and the amount actually received by ECGC and private insurance companies regulated by IRDA.
C.5 SOFTEX Forms
(i) A software exporter, whose annual turnover is at least Rs. 1000 crore or who files at least 600 SOFTEX forms annually, will be eligible to submit a statement in excel format as per Annexure A, giving all particulars along with quadruplicate set of SOFTEX form to the nearest STPI. STPI will then verify the details and decide on a percentage sample check of the documents in details. Software companies will submit all the documents on demand to STPI within 30 days of their advice or any reasonable/extended time at the discretion of the Director, STPI, at the request from the exporter. STPI will thus certify the statement and SOFTEX forms in bulk on the “Top Sheet” regarding the values etc. and will thereafter forward the first copy of the revised SOFTEX format to the concerned Regional Office of RBI, the duplicate copy along with bulk statement in excel format to Authorised Dealers for negotiation / collection / settlement, the third copy to the exporter and the last copy will be retained by STPI for its own record. Under the revised procedure, the exporters, however, will have to provide information about all the invoices including the ones lesser than US$25000, in the bulk statement in excel format. [The revised procedure for submission of the SOFTEX form and other relevant documents are detailed in the Annex 4]
The procedure has been effective at all STPIs and SEZs / EPZs / 100%EOU / DTA since 1.1.2013.
(ii) A common “SOFTEX Form” (Annex 3) has been devised to declare single as well as bulk software exports.
(iii) Reserve Bank of India has extended the facility for online generation of the EDF Form Number and the SOFTEX Form Number (Single as well as Bulk for use in off-site software exports). The facility of manual allotment of single as well bulk SOFTEX form number by Regional Offices of RBI has been dispensed with accordingly.
C.6 Random verification
(iv) In all the above procedures, AD Category – I bank should ensure, by random check of the relevant duplicate forms by their internal / concurrent auditors, that non-realization or short realization allowed, if any, is within the powers delegated to them or has been duly approved by the Reserve Bank, wherever necessary.
C.7 Certification for EEFC Credits
Where a part of the export proceeds are credited to an EEFC account, the export declaration (duplicate) form may be certified as under:
“Proceeds amounting to …… representing ….. percent of the export realisation credited to the EEFC account maintained by the exporter with……”
C.8 Consolidation of Air Cargo/Sea Cargo
(i) Consolidation of Air Cargo
(a) Where air cargo is shipped under consolidation, the airline company’s Master Airway Bill will be issued to the Consolidating Cargo Agent. The Cargo agent in turn will issue his own House Airway Bills (HAWBs) to individual shippers.
(b) AD Category – I banks may negotiate HAWBs only if the relative letter of credit specifically provides for negotiation of these documents in lieu of Airway Bills issued by the airline company.
(ii) Consolidation of Sea Cargo
(a) AD Category – I banks may accept Forwarder’s Cargo Receipts (FCR) issued by IATA approved agents, in lieu of bills of lading, for negotiation / collection of shipping documents, in respect of export transactions backed by letters of credit, if the relative letter of credit specifically provides for negotiation of this document, in lieu of bill of lading even if the relative sale contract with the overseas buyer does not provide for acceptance of FCR as a shipping document, in lieu of bill of lading
(b) Further, Authorized Dealers may, at their discretion, also accept FCR issued by Shipping companies of repute/IATA approved agents (in lieu of bill of lading), for purchase/discount/collection of shipping documents even in cases, where export transactions are not backed by letters of credit, provided their 'relative sale contract' with overseas buyer provides for acceptance of FCR as a shipping document in lieu of bill of lading. However, the acceptance of such FCR for purchase/discount would purely be the credit decision of the bank concerned who, among others, should satisfy itself about the bona fides of the transaction and the track record of the overseas buyer and the Indian supplier since FCRs are not negotiable documents. It would be advisable for the exporters to ensure due diligence on the overseas buyer, in such cases.
C.9 Delay in submission of shipping documents by exporters
In cases where exporters present documents pertaining to exports after the prescribed period of 21 days from date of export, AD Category – I banks may handle them without prior approval of the Reserve Bank, provided they are satisfied with the reasons for the delay.
C.10 Check-list for Scrutiny of Forms
AD Category – I banks may ensure:
(i) The number on the duplicate copy of the EDF presented to them is the same as that of the original which is usually recorded on the Bill of Lading/Shipping Bill and the duplicate has been duly verified and authenticated by appropriate Customs authorities.
(ii) In the case of c.i.f., c.& f. etc. contracts where the freight is sought to be paid at destination, that the deduction made is only to the extent of freight declared on EDF or the actual amount of freight indicated on the Bill of Lading/Airway Bill, whichever is less.
(iii) The documents submitted do not reveal any material inter se discrepancies in regard to description of goods exported; export value or country of destination.
(iv) Where the marine insurance is taken by the exporters on buyer’s account to verify, that the actual amount paid is received from the buyer through invoice and the bill.
(v) To accept the Bill of Lading/Airway Bill issued on ‘freight prepaid’ basis where the sale contract is on f.o.b., f.a.s. etc. basis provided the amount of freight has been included in the invoice and the bill.
(vi) To negotiate the documents, in cases where the documents are being negotiated by a person other than the exporter who has signed EDF/SOFTEX Form for the export consignment concerned, after ensuring compliance with Regulation 12 of Foreign Exchange Management (Export of Goods and Services) Regulations, 2000.
(vii) To accept the variations in the value declared to the customs authorities and that is reflected on the export documents which stem from the terms of contract, on production of documentary evidence after verifying the arithmetical accuracy of the calculations and on conforming the terms of underlying contracts. Some such instances (where the values declared to the customs authorities and that shown on the documents may differ) are enumerated hereunder:
(viii) The export realizable value may be more than what was originally declared to/accepted by the Customs on the EDF in certain circumstances such as where in c.i.f. or c. & f. contracts, part or whole of any freight increase taking place after the contract was concluded is agreed to be borne by buyers or where as a result of subsequent devaluation of the currency of the contract, buyers have agreed to an increase in price.
(ix) In certain lines of export trade, the final settlement of price may be dependent on the results of quality analysis of samples drawn at the time of shipment; but the results of such analysis will become available only after the shipment has been made. Sometimes, contracts may provide for payment of penalty for late shipment of goods in conformity with trade practice concerning the commodity. In these cases, while exporters declare to the Customs the full export value based on the contract price, invoices submitted along with shipping documents for negotiation/ collection may reflect a different value arrived at after taking into account the results of analysis of samples or late shipment penalty, as the case may be.
(x) To accept for negotiation or collection the bills for exports by sea or air which fall short of the value declared on EDF on account of trade, only if the discount has been declared by the exporter on relative EDF at the time of shipment and accepted by Customs.
C.11 Return of Documents to Exporters
The duplicate copies of EDF and shipping documents, once submitted to the AD Category – I banks for negotiation, collection, etc., should not ordinarily be returned to exporters, except for rectification of errors and resubmission.
C.12 Handing Over Negotiable Copy of Bill of Lading to Master of Vessel/Trade Representative
AD Category – I banks may deliver one negotiable copy of the Bill of Lading to the Master of the carrying vessel or trade representative for exports to certain landlocked countries if the shipment is covered by an irrevocable letter of credit and the documents conform strictly to the terms of the Letter of Credit which, inter alia, provides for such delivery.
C.13 Export Bills Register
(i) AD Category – I banks should maintain Export Bills Register, in physical or electronic form. Details of EDF/SOFTEX form number, due date of payment, the fortnightly period of R Supplementary Return with which the ENC statement covering the transaction was sent to the Reserve Bank, should be available.
(ii) AD Category – I banks should ensure that all types of export transactions are entered in the Export Bills Register and are given bill numbers on a financial year basis (i.e. April to March).
(iii) The bill numbers should be recorded in ENC statement and other relevant returns submitted to the Reserve Bank.
C.14 Follow-up of Overdue Bills
(i) AD Category – I banks should closely watch realization of bills and in cases where bills remain outstanding, beyond the due date for payment from the date of export, the matter should be promptly taken up with the concerned exporter. If the exporter fails to arrange for delivery of the proceeds within the stipulated period or seek extension of time beyond the stipulated period, the matter should be reported to the Regional Office concerned of the Reserve Bank stating, where possible, the reason for the delay in realizing the proceeds.
(ii) The duplicate copies of EDF/SOFTEX Forms should, continue to be held by AD Category – I banks until the full proceeds are realised, except in case of undrawn balances.
(iii) AD Category – I banks should follow up export outstanding with exporters systematically and vigorously so that action against defaulting exporters does not get delayed. Any laxity in the follow up of realization of export proceeds by AD Category – I banks will be viewed seriously by the Reserve Bank, leading to the invocation of the penal provision under FEMA, 1999.
(iv) With effect from the half year ending December 2013, half yearly XOS submission should be made online and Bank-wide instead of the present system of branch-wise submission through the respective Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India
C.15 Reduction in Invoice Value on Account of Prepayment of Usance Bills
Occasionally, exporters may approach AD Category – I banks for reduction in invoice value on account of cash discount to overseas buyers for prepayment of the usance bills. AD Category – I banks may allow cash discount to the extent of amount of proportionate interest on the unexpired period of usance, calculated at the rate of interest stipulated in the export contract or at the prime rate/LIBOR of the currency of invoice where rate of interest is not stipulated in the contract.
C.16 Reduction in Invoice Value in other cases
(i) If, after a bill has been negotiated or sent for collection, its amount is to be reduced for any reason, AD Category – I banks may approve such reduction, if satisfied about genuineness of the request, provided:
(a) The reduction does not exceed 25 per cent of invoice value:
(b) It does not relate to export of commodities subject to floor price stipulations
The exporter is not on the exporters’ caution list of the Reserve Bank, and
(c) The exporter is advised to surrender proportionate export incentives availed of, if any.
(ii) In the case of exporters who have been in the export business for more than three years, reduction in invoice value may be allowed, without any percentage ceiling, subject to the above conditions as also subject to their track record being satisfactory, i.e., the export outstanding do not exceed 5 per cent of the average annual export realization during the preceding three financial years.
(iii) For the purpose of reckoning the percentage of export bills outstanding to the average export realizations during the preceding three financial years, outstanding of exports made to countries facing externalization problems may be ignored provided the payments have been made by the buyers in the local currency.
C.17 Export Claims
(i) AD Category – I banks may remit export claims on application, provided the relative export proceeds have already been realised and repatriated to India and the exporter is not on the caution list of the Reserve Bank.
(ii) In all such cases of remittances, the exporter should be advised to surrender proportionate export incentives, if any, received by him.
C.18 Change of buyer/consignee
Prior approval of the Reserve Bank is not required if, after goods have been shipped, they are to be transferred to a buyer other than the original buyer in the event of default by the latter, provided the reduction in value, if any, involved does not exceed 25 per cent of the invoice value and the realization of export proceeds is not delayed beyond the period of 12 months from the date of export.
C.19 Extension of Time
(i) The Reserve Bank of India has permitted the AD Category – I banks to extend the period of realization of export proceeds beyond 12 months from the date of export, up to a period of six months, at a time, irrespective of the invoice value of the export subject to the following conditions:
(a) The export transactions covered by the invoices are not under investigation by Directorate of Enforcement / Central Bureau of Investigation or other investigating agencies,
(b) The AD Category – I bank is satisfied that the exporter has not been able to realise export proceeds for reasons beyond his control,
(c) The exporter submits a declaration that the export proceeds will be realised during the extended period,
(d) While considering extension beyond one year from the date of export, the total outstanding of the exporter does not exceed USD one million or 10 per cent of the average export realizations during the preceding three financial years, whichever is higher.
(e) All the export bills outstanding beyond six months from the date of export may be reported in XOS statement. However, where extension of time has been granted by the AD Category – I banks, the date up to which extension has been granted may be indicated in the ‘Remarks’ column.
(f) In cases where the exporter has filed suits abroad against the buyer, extension may be granted irrespective of the amount involved / outstanding.
(ii) In cases where an exporter has not been able to realise proceeds of a shipment made within the extended period for reasons beyond his control, but expects to be able to realise proceeds if further extension of the period is allowed to him, as well as in respect of cases not covered under Para (i) above necessary application (in duplicate) should be made to the Regional Office concerned of the Reserve Bank in form ETX through his AD Category – I bank with appropriate documentary evidence.
C.20 Write off of export bills
(i) An exporter who has not been able to realise the outstanding export dues despite best efforts, may either self-write off or approach the AD Category – I banks, who had handled the relevant shipping documents, with appropriate supporting documentary evidence with a request for write off of the unrealised portion subject to the fulfilment of stipulations regarding surrender of incentives prior to ”write-off” adduced in the A.P. (DIR Series) Circular No. 03 dated 22 July 2010. After liberalizing and simplifying the procedure, the limits prescribed for “write-offs” of unrealized export bills are as under:
Self “write-off” by an exporter
(Other than Status Holder Exporter)                   5%*
Self “write-off” by Status Holder Exporters         10%*
‘Write-off” by Authorized Dealer Bank-               10%*
*of the total export proceeds realized during the previous calendar year.
(ii) The above limits will be related to total export proceeds realized during the previous calendar year and will be cumulatively available in a year.
(iii) The above “write-off” will be subject to conditions that the relevant amount has remained outstanding for more than one year, satisfactory documentary evidence is furnished in support of the exporter having made all efforts to realize the dues, and the case falls under any of the undernoted categories:
(a) The overseas buyer has been declared insolvent and a certificate from the official liquidator indicating that there is no possibility of recovery of export proceeds has been produced.
(b) The overseas buyer is not traceable over a reasonably long period of time.
(c) The goods exported have been auctioned or destroyed by the Port / Customs / Health authorities in the importing country.
(d) The unrealized amount represents the balance due in a case settled through the intervention of the Indian Embassy, Foreign Chamber of Commerce or similar Organization;
(e) The unrealized amount represents the undrawn balance of an export bill (not exceeding 10% of the invoice value) remaining outstanding and turned out to be unrealizable despite all efforts made by the exporter;
(f) The cost of resorting to legal action would be disproportionate to the unrealized amount of the export bill or where the exporter even after winning the Court case against the overseas buyer could not execute the Court decree due to reasons beyond his control;
(g) Bills were drawn for the difference between the letter of credit value and actual export value or between the provisional and the actual freight charges but the amounts have remained unrealized consequent on dishonour of the bills by the overseas buyer and there are no prospects of realization.
(iv) The exporter has surrendered proportionate export incentives (for the cases not covered under
A. P. (DIR. Series) Circular No.03 dated July 22, 2010
), if any, availed of in respect of the relative shipments. The AD Category – I banks should obtain documents evidencing surrender of export incentives availed of before permitting the relevant bills to be written off.
(v) In case of self-write-off, the exporter should submit to the concerned AD bank, a Chartered Accountant’s certificate, indicating the export realization in the preceding calendar year and also the amount of write-off already availed of during the year, if any, the relevant EDF to be written off, Bill No., invoice value, commodity exported, country of export. The CA certificate may also indicate that the export benefits, if any, availed of by the exporter have been surrendered.
(vi) However, the following would not qualify for the “write off” facility :
(a) Exports made to countries with externalization problem i.e. where the overseas buyer has deposited the value of export in local currency but the amount has not been allowed to be repatriated by the central banking authorities of the country.
(b) EDF which are under investigation by agencies like, Enforcement Directorate, Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Central Bureau of Investigation, etc. as also the outstanding bills which are subject matter of civil / criminal suit.
vii) The respective AD banks may forward a statement in form EBW, in the enclosed format, to the Regional Office of Reserve Bank under whose jurisdiction they are functioning, indicating details of write-offs allowed under this circular.
viii) AD banks are advised to put in place a system under which their internal inspectors or auditors (including external auditors appointed by authorised dealers) should carry out random sample check / percentage check of “write-off” outstanding export bills.
ix) Cases not covered by the above instructions / beyond the above limits, may be referred to the concerned Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India.
C.21 Write off in cases of Payment of Claims by ECGC and private insurance companies regulated by Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA)
(i) AD Category – I banks shall, on an application received from the exporter supported by documentary evidence from the ECGC and private insurance companies regulated by IRDA confirming that the claim in respect of the outstanding bills has been settled by them, write off the relative export bills and delete them from the XOS statement.
