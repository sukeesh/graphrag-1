2. The Government of India, Ministry of Housing and  Urban Poverty Alleviation (MoHUPA), has restructured the existing Swarna  Jayanti Shahari Rozgar Yojana (SJSRY) and launched the National Urban  Livelihoods Mission (NULM). The Self Employment Programme (SEP) component of  NULM will focus on providing financial assistance through a provision of  interest subsidy on loans to support establishment of Individual & Group  Enterprises and Self-Help Groups ((SHGs) of urban poor.
3. The existing provision of capital subsidy for USEP  (Urban Self Employment Programme) and UWSP (Urban Women Self-Help Programme)  components of SJSRY has been replaced by interest subsidy for loans to  Individual enterprise (SEP- I), Group enterprise (SEP- G) and Self Help Groups (SHGs)
4. We have been advised by the Ministry that the NULM  is under implementation w.e.f. September 24, 2013 in all districts headquarters  (irrespective of population) and all the cities with population of 1 lakh or  more and that SJSRY was to remain operational till March 31, 2014. Accordingly,  capital subsidy as per SJSRY guidelines will also be extended on bank loans for  setting up of individual and group enterprises under USEP and UWSP components  of SJSRY, respectively till March 31, 2014.
5. The  operational guidelines of the Self Employment Programme (SEP) component of  NULM, are
