in terms of which current account holders (applicable to Current Accounts which are operational for last three months or more) were allowed to withdraw up to ₹ 50000 in cash, in a week. On a review, it has been decided to extend this facility to Overdraft and Cash Credit accounts also. Accordingly, holders of current / overdraft / cash credit accounts, which are operational for the last three months or more, may now withdraw upto ₹ 50000 in cash, in a week. This enhanced limit for weekly withdrawal is not applicable for personal overdraft accounts.
2. Such withdrawals may be disbursed predominantly in ₹ 2000 denomination bank notes.
Yours faithfully,
