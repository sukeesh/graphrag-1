In exercise of the powers conferred under Section 35A and Section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Reserve Bank of India being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in the public interest to do so, hereby, issues the Directions hereinafter specified.

The Counterfeit Notes can be impounded by:
All Banks
Issue Offices of Reserve Bank of India

2.1 Banknotes tendered over the counter shall be examined for authenticity through machines. Similarly, banknotes received directly at the back office / currency chest through bulk tenders shall also be examined through machines.
2.2 No credit to customer’s account is to be given for Counterfeit Notes, if any, detected in the tender received over the counter or at the back-office / currency chest.
2.3 In no case, the Counterfeit Notes shall be returned to the tenderer or destroyed by the bank branches. Failure of the banks to impound Counterfeit Notes detected at their end will be construed as wilful involvement of the bank concerned in circulating Counterfeit Notes and penalty will be imposed.
3. Impounding of Counterfeit Notes
Notes determined as counterfeit shall be stamped as "COUNTERFEIT NOTE" and impounded in the prescribed format (
Annex I
). Each such impounded note shall be recorded under authentication, in a separate register.

When a banknote tendered at the counter of a bank branch / back office and currency chest is found to be counterfeit, an acknowledgement receipt in the prescribed format (
Annex II
) must be issued to the tenderer, after stamping the note as in Paragraph 3 ibid. The receipt, in running serial numbers, shall be authenticated by the cashier and tenderer. Notice to this effect shall be displayed prominently at the offices / branches for information of the public. The receipt is to be issued even in cases where the tenderer is unwilling to countersign it.

5.2 For cases of detection of Counterfeit Notes of five (05) or more pieces in a single transaction, the Counterfeit Notes shall be forwarded
immediately
by the Nodal Bank Officer to the local police authorities or the Nodal Police Station for investigation by filing FIR in the prescribed format (

If the Counterfeit Notes are sent to the police by insured post, acknowledgement of receipt thereof by the police shall be invariably obtained and kept on record. A proper follow-up of receipt of acknowledgement from the police authorities is necessary. In case any difficulty is faced by the Offices / Branches due to reluctance of the police to receive monthly consolidated statement / file FIRs, the matter may be sorted out in consultation with the Nodal Officer of the police authority designated to coordinate matters relating to investigation of Counterfeit Notes cases. The list of Nodal Police Stations may be obtained from the concerned Issue Office of the Reserve Bank of India.
5.5 In order to facilitate identification of people abetting circulation of Counterfeit Notes, banks are advised to cover the banking hall / area and counters under CCTV surveillance and preserve the recording as per their internal policy.
5.6 Banks shall also monitor the patterns / trends of such detection and suspicious trends / patterns shall be brought to the notice of RBI / Police authorities immediately.
5.7 The progress made by banks in detection and reporting of Counterfeit Notes to Police, RBI, etc. and problems therein, shall be discussed regularly in the meetings of various State Level Committees viz.
