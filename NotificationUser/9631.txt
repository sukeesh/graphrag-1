Dear Sir,
Prudential Guidelines on Capital Adequacy and  Liquidity Standards - Amendments
As you are aware, the Reserve Bank has issued and implemented prudential guidelines on capital adequacy framework and liquidity standards for banks  operating in India. These guidelines have been framed based on the  internationally accepted reform package, as agreed to by the Basel Committee on  Banking Supervision (BCBS) and endorsed by the G20 Leaders post-crisis.  Accordingly, it is important to adopt and implement  these minimum prudential standards in a manner which is consistent across all  member jurisdictions. Such consistent implementation not only provides a level playing field for banks but also reduces regulatory  arbitrage and promotes financial stability to a great extent.
2. In this context, it is considered desirable to make certain  modifications / amendments to the guidelines on Basel III capital and liquidity  regulations, implementation of advanced model-based approaches for credit,  market and operational risk, guidelines on compensation and securitisation  exposures, etc., with a view to more closely align our regulatory framework  with the internationally agreed standards.
3. Accordingly, the above modifications / amendments are given  in the
Annex
. These changes  become applicable with effect from April 1, 2015.
Yours faithfully,
(Sudarshan Sen)
Chief General  Manager-in-Charge
