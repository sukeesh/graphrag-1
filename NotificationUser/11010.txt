Dear Sir / Madam
Payment of agency commission for government receipts
Please refer to
Circular No. DGBA.GAD.7575/31.12.011/2011-12 dated May 22, 2012
regarding the rationalisation and revision of agency commission payable to agency banks on government transactions undertaken by them.
2. As you are aware, the agency commission on government receipts is paid by Reserve Bank per transaction basis. In this connection, with reference to the implementation of Goods and Service Tax (GST) regime, it is advised that a single Common Portal Identification Number (CPIN), processed successfully leading to generation of a Challan Identification Number (CIN), under GST payment process, may be treated as a single transaction, even if multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts are credited. This means that CGST, SGST, IGST and Cess etc. paid through a single challan would constitute a single transaction. Thus, all such records clubbed under a single challan i.e., CPIN have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission. This will come into effect from July 1, 2017.
3. Similarly, in case of transactions not covered under GST, it is emphasised that a single challan (electronic or physical) should be treated as single transaction only and not multiple transactions, even if the challan contains multiple major head/sub major head/minor head of accounts that will get credited. We reiterate that records clubbed under a single challan processed successfully have to be treated as a single transaction for the purpose of claiming agency commission.
Yours faithfully
