The Chairman/Chief Executive Officer
All agency banks
Dear Sir/Madam,
Annual Closing of Government Accounts – Transactions of Central/State Governments – Special Measures for the Current Financial Year (2014-15)
The Government of India has desired that all government transactions with banks must be accounted for within the same financial year and has requested that certain special arrangements be made for the purpose, as in previous years. Accordingly, it has been decided that all agency banks shall keep the counters of their designated branches conducting government business open for full day on March 30, 2015, and till 8.00 p.m. on March 31, 2015. All electronic transactions would, however, continue till midnight of March 31, 2015. Banks may give adequate publicity to the special arrangements made.
2. As regards conduct of extended clearing sessions / operations on these two dates, separate guidelines are being issued by our Department of Payment and Settlement Systems, Central Office, Mumbai.
Yours faithfully
(Monisha Chakraborty)
General Manager
