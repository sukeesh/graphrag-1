Dear Sir,
Know Your Customer (KYC)/Anti-Money Laundering (AML)/Combating
of Financing of Terrorism (CFT) Guidelines - Unique Customer
Identification Code (UCIC) for banks’ customers in India
Please refer to our
circular DBOD. AML.BC. No.109/14.01.001/2011-12 dated June 08,  2012
, on the captioned subject, advising banks to initiate steps for allotting  UCIC to all their customers while entering into any new relationships for  individual customers to begin with, and to existing individual customers by  end-May 2013. The period for completion of allotment of UCIC was extended upto  March 31, 2014, vide our
circular DBOD. AML.BC. No.101/14.01.001/2012-13 dated May  31, 2013
.
2. In this regard, it has come to the  notice of Reserve Bank that some banks are yet to complete the allotment of  UCIC and accordingly have sought some more time. In view the requests received,  it has been decided to extend the time for completing the process of allotting  UCIC to existing customers up to December 31, 2014.
3. Banks are, therefore, advised to  expedite the procedure and complete the work of allotting UCIC to all the  existing individual customers, within the stipulated timeframe. They may chalk  out a plan for completing the work and furnish the monthly progress report to  their Board. Considering the fact that a period of two years has been allotted  for completion of the task, no further extension in this regard would be  considered.
4. It is mandatory  for banks to comply with these instructions and non-compliance would invite  penal consequences.
Yours faithfully,
(Lily Vadera)
Chief General Manager
