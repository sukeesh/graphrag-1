Risk Weight in respect of investments in Corporate Bonds
by Standalone Primary Dealers (SPDs)
In terms of the Capital Adequacy Standards and Risk Management Guidelines for SPDs, risk weight of 100% has been stipulated in respect of investments in corporate bonds, for the purpose of calculating capital adequacy.
2. On a review, in order to bring parity with risk weights assigned to investment in corporate bonds by SPDs and banks, it has been decided to link the risk weights, assigned by SPDs to their investments in corporate bonds, to the rating of the bonds as under:
A. Short term instruments (bonds ≤ 1 year maturity)
CARE
CRISIL
