Dear Sir,
Customer Service in State/District Central Co-operative  Banks (StCBs/DCCBs)
Customer service has great significance in the banking  industry. The banking system in India today has tremendous outreach for  delivery of financial services. It is expected that the quality of customer  service will show commensurate improvement in line with the increasing  expectations of the banksâ€™ customers.

Reserve Bank, as the regulator of State/District  Central Co-operative Banks (StCBs/DCCBs) has been actively engaged from the  very beginning in the review, examination and evaluation of customer service in  StCBs/DCCBs by means of various guidelines issued from time to time to the StCBs/DCCBs.  On a review it is felt necessary to issue additional instructions to StCBs/DCCBs  on other areas of customer service aligning with those issued to Scheduled  Commercial Banks. These guidelines would be required to be complied by StCBs/DCCBs  in addition to instructions already issued on Customer Service. The additional  guidelines are given in
