The Chairmen / Chief  Executives of
All Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs)
Collection of Account Payee  Cheques -
Prohibition on Crediting Proceeds to Third Party Account
Please refer to our
circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.50/21.01.001/2011-12 dated  November 4, 2011
advising banks that they are prohibited from  crediting 'account payee' cheques to the account of any person other than the  payee named therein. We reiterate these instructions and advise that banks  should strictly collect ‘account payee’ cheques only for their payee  constituents.
2. Banks may, however, consider  collecting account payee cheques drawn for an amount not exceeding Rs.50,000/-  to the account of their customers who are co-operative credit societies, if the  payees of such cheques are the constituents of such co-operative credit  societies, as advised in our above circular dated November 4, 2011.
Yours faithfully,
(Chandan Sinha)
Principal Chief General  Manager
