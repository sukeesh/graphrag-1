The Chairmen / Chief Executive Officers of
All Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks)
Dear Sir,
Due diligence in correspondent banking relationship.
Please refer to
paragraph 2.16
of our Master  Circular DBOD. AML.BC.24/14.01.001/2012-13 dated July 1, 2013 on ‘Know Your  Customer (KYC) Norms / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Standards/ Combating of  Financing of Terrorism (CFT) / Obligation of banks under PMLA, 2002’ in terms  of which banks have been advised to carry out detailed due diligence while entering into  correspondent banking arrangements, including information on the other bank’s  management, major business activities, level of AML/ CFT compliance, purpose of  opening the account, identity of any third party entities that will use the  correspondent banking services etc. Further, banks may refer to our circular  DBOD.No.BP.BC.24/21.01.023/98 dated March 30, 1998 on ‘Frauds in Banks/ Grant  of ‘At Par’ facility for Dividend/ Interest Warrants and Refund Orders’, in  terms of which banks have been advised to put in place adequate internal control  mechanism to safeguard their interests while determining the policy regarding  ‘at par’ facility with the approval of their respective Boards.
2. It  has been observed that some commercial banks have arrangements with  co-operative banks wherein the latter open current accounts with the commercial  banks and use the cheque book facility to issue ‘at par’ cheques to their  constituents and walk-in- customers for facilitating their remittances and  payments. Since the ‘at par’ facility offered by commercial banks to  co-operative banks is in the nature of  correspondent banking arrangements, banks should monitor and review such  arrangements to assess the risks including credit risk and reputational risk  arising therefrom. For this purpose, banks  should retain the right to verify the records maintained by the client  cooperative banks/ societies for compliance with the extant instructions on KYC  and AML under such arrangements.
Yours faithfully,
(Prakash  Chandra Sahoo)
Chief General Manager
