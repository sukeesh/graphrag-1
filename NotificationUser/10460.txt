To CEOs of All NBFCs (excluding RNBCs) and
The President of ICAI
Dear Sir/Madam,
Format of Statutory Auditors’ Certificate (SAC) to be submitted by NBFCs
Please refer to the
Notification No. DNBS 192/DG (VL) dated Feb 22, 2007
prescribing Prudential Norms Directions. In terms of the extant instructions, all NBFCs are required to submit a certificate from their Statutory Auditors every year to the effect that they continue to engage in the business of NBFI requiring it to hold a CoR under Section 45-IA of the RBI Act.
2.
With a view to ensure consistency in the manner in which the information is received from the Auditors, it has been decided to introduce a uniform format of the SAC. The NBFC would need to fill in the information, as applicable, in COSMOS. Thereafter, the SAC needs to be scanned and uploaded in COSMOS
https://cosmos.rbi.org.in
under the menu Upload Returns > Statutory Auditors Certificate. The
format of the SAC
is attached herewith.
Yours faithfully
(Dr. Sathyan David)
