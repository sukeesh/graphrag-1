Dear Sir,
Flexible  Structuring of Long Term Project Loans to
Infrastructure  and Core Industries
During the last decade, commercial banks have  become the primary source of long term debt financing to projects in  infrastructure and core industries. Infrastructure and core industries projects  are characterised by long gestation periods and large capital investments. The  long maturities of such project loans consist of the initial construction  period and the economic life of the asset /underlying concession period  (usually 25-30 years). In order to ensure stress free repayment of such long  gestation loans, their repayment tenor should bear some correspondence to the  period when cash flows are generated by the asset.
2. Banks  have been representing to us that they are unable to provide such long tenor  financing owing to asset-liability mismatch issues. To overcome the asset  liability mismatch, they invariably restrict their finance to a maximum period  of 12-15 years. After factoring in the initial construction period and repayment  moratorium, the repayment of the bank loan is compressed to a shorter period of  10-12 years (with resultant higher loan instalments), which not only strains  the viability of the project, but also constrains the ability of promoters to  generate fresh equity out of internal generation for further investments. It  might also lead to levying higher user charges in the case of infrastructure  projects in order to ensure that greater cash flows are generated to service  the loans. As a result of these factors, some of the long term projects have  been experiencing stress in servicing the project loan.
3. With a view to overcoming these problems,  banks have requested that they may be allowed to fix longer amortisation period  for loans to projects in infrastructure and core industries sectors, say 25  years, based on the economic life or concession period of the project, with  periodic refinancing, say every 5 years. Banks have indicated that:
this  would ensure long term viability of infrastructure/core industries sector  projects by smoothening the cash flow stress in initial years;
they  would be able to extend finance to such projects without getting adversely  impacted by asset-liability management (ALM) issues;
the  need for restructuring (owing to initial stressed cash flows due to 10-12 year  loan tenors normally fixed) would be minimised, allowing  banks to once again take up financing /  refinancing of these project loans;
they  could shed or take up exposures  at different stages of the life cycle of such  projects depending on  bank’s single /  group borrower or sectoral exposure limits;
with reduction of project risk and option of refinancing, ratings of  such projects would undergo upward revision allowing lower capital requirement  for banks as also access to corporate bond markets to project promoters at any  stage based on such refinancing; etc.
4. It has also been suggested by banks that, the  long tenor loans to infrastructure/core industries projects, say 25 years,  could be structured as under:
The  fundamental viability of the project would be established on the basis of all  requisite financial and non-financial parameters, especially the acceptable  level of interest coverage ratio (EBIDTA / Interest payout), indicating  capacity to service the loan and ability to repay over the tenor of the loan;
Allowing  longer tenor amortisation of the loan (Amortisation Schedule), say 25 years  (within the useful life / concession period of the project) with periodic  refinancing (Refinancing Debt Facility) of balance debt, the tenor of which  could be fixed at the time of each refinancing, within the overall amortisation  period;
This  would mean that the bank, while assessing the viability of the project, would  be allowed to accept the project as a viable project where the average debt  service coverage ratio (DSCR) and other financial and non-financial parameters  are acceptable over a longer amortisation period of say 25 years (Amortisation  Schedule), but provide funding (Initial Debt Facility) for only, say, 5 years  with refinancing of balance debt being allowed by existing or new banks  (Refinancing Debt Facility) or even through bonds; and
The refinancing (Refinancing Debt Facility) after each of these 5 years  would be of the reduced amounts determined as per the Original Amortisation  Schedule.
5. Against this backdrop, in the Union Budget  2014-15, presented on July 10, 2014, the Hon’ble Finance Minster announced  that:
“131.
Long term financing for  infrastructure has been a major constraint in encouraging larger private sector  participation in this sector. On the asset side, banks will be encouraged to  extend long term loans to infrastructure sector with flexible structuring to  absorb potential adverse contingencies, sometimes known as the 5/25 structure.  On the liability side, banks will be permitted to raise long term funds for  lending to infrastructure sector with minimum regulatory pre-emption such as  CRR, SLR and Priority Sector Lending (PSL).”
6. The issues have been examined by the Reserve  Bank of India (RBI). It is clarified that RBI has not prescribed any ceiling or  floor on repayment period of loans, except in the case of special regulatory  treatment for asset classification on restructuring

.  Paragraph 1.3 of Master Circular – Prudential Norms on Income Recognition, Asset  Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances, urges banks to ensure  that while granting loans and advances, realistic repayment schedules are fixed  on the basis of cash flows with borrowers as it would go a long way to  facilitate prompt repayment by the borrowers and thus improve the record of  recovery in advances.  Further, in terms  of circular   DBOD.No.BP.BC.144/21.04.048-2000 dated February 29, 2000 on ‘Income Recognition,  Asset Classification, Provisioning and other related matters and Capital  Adequacy Standards - Takeout Finance’, banks can refinance their existing  infrastructure project loans by entering into take-out financing agreements  with any financial institution (FI) on a pre-determined basis. If there is no  pre-determined agreement, a standard account in the books of a bank can still  be taken over by other banks/FIs, subject to guidelines on ‘Transfer of Borrowal Accounts from one Bank to Another’  issued vide
circular DBOD.No.BP.BC-104/21.04.048/2011-12 dated May  10, 2012
.
7. Further, in partial modification to the  above-mentioned circular dated February 29, 2000, banks were advised, vide
circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.98/21.04.132/2013-14 dated February 26, 2014
on  ‘Framework for Revitalising Distressed Assets in the Economy - Refinancing of  Project Loans, Sale of NPA and Other Regulatory Measures’, that if they  refinance any existing infrastructure and other project loans by way of  take-out financing, even without a pre-determined agreement with other banks /  FIs, and fix a longer repayment period, the same would not be considered as  restructuring if the following conditions are satisfied:
Such loans should be ‘standard’ in the books of the existing banks, and  should have not been restructured in the past;
Such loans should be substantially taken over (more than 50% of the  outstanding loan by value) from the existing financing banks/Financial  institutions; and
The  repayment period should be fixed by taking into account the life cycle of the  project and cash flows from the project.
8. In view of the above, RBI’s instructions do  not come in the way of banks’ structuring long term project financing products,  insofar as the prudential and regulatory framework is meticulously observed  while structuring such products. However, as banks have certain misgivings that  such refinancing of long term project loans may be construed as restructuring,  and the estimated cash flows (balance debt in the form of bullet payment) at  the end of each refinancing period  may  not be allowed to be counted  in the  appropriate maturity buckets for the purpose of ALM,  the RBI clarifies that it would not have any  objection to banks’ financing of long term projects in infrastructure and core  industries sector as suggested in paragraph 4 above, provided that:
Only  term loans to infrastructure projects, as defined under the Harmonised Master  List of Infrastructure of RBI, and projects in core industries sector, included  in the Index of Eight Core Industries (base: 2004-05) published by the Ministry  of Commerce and Industry, Government of India, (viz., coal, crude oil, natural  gas, petroleum refinery products, fertilisers, steel (Alloy + Non Alloy),  cement and electricity - some of these sectors such as fertilisers, electricity  generation, distribution and transmission, etc. are also included in the  Harmonised Master List of Infrastructure sub-sectors) - will qualify for such  refinancing;
At  the time of initial appraisal of such projects, banks may fix an  amortisation schedule (Original Amortisation  Schedule) while ensuring that  the  cash flows from such projects and all  necessary financial and non-financial parameters are robust even under stress  scenarios;
The  tenor of the Amortisation Schedule should not be more than 80% (leaving a tail  of 20%) of the initial concession period in case of infrastructure projects  under public private partnership (PPP) model; or 80% of the initial economic  life envisaged at the time of project appraisal for determining the user  charges / tariff in case of non-PPP infrastructure projects; or 80% of the  initial economic life envisaged at the time of project appraisal by Lenders  Independent Engineer in the case of other core industries projects;
The  bank offering the Initial Debt Facility may sanction the loan for a medium  term, say 5 to 7 years. This is to take care of initial construction period and  also cover the period at least up to the date of commencement of commercial  operations (DCCO) and revenue ramp up. The repayment(s) at the end of this  period (equal in present value to the remaining residual payments corresponding  to the Original Amortisation Schedule) could be structured as a bullet  repayment, with the intent specified up front that it will be refinanced. That  repayment may be taken up by the same lender or a set of new lenders, or  combination of both, or by issue of corporate bond, as Refinancing Debt  Facility, and such refinancing may repeat till the end of the Amortisation  Schedule;
The  repayment schedules of Initial Debt Facility should normally correspond to the  Original Amortisation Schedule, unless there is an extension of DCCO. In that  case, in terms of extant instructions contained in ‘
Master Circular –  Prudential Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning  pertaining to Advances
’ dated July 1, 2014, mere extension of DCCO would not be  considered as restructuring subject to certain conditions, if the revised DCCO  falls within the period of two years and one year from the original DCCO for  infrastructure and non-infrastructure projects respectively. In such cases the  consequential shift in repayment schedule by equal or shorter duration  (including the start date and end date of revised repayment schedule) than the  extension of DCCO would also not be considered as restructuring provided all  other terms and conditions of the loan remain unchanged or are enhanced to  compensate for the delay and the entire project debt amortisation is scheduled  within 85%

of the initial economic life  of the project as prescribed in paragraph 8 (iii) above;
The Amortisation Schedule of a project loan may be modified once during  the course of the loan (after DCCO) based on the actual performance of the  project in comparison to the assumptions made during the financial closure  without being treated as ‘restructuring’ provided:
a) The loan is a standard loan as on the date of  change of Amortisation Schedule;
b) Net present value of the loan remains the same  before and after the change in Amortisation Schedule; and
c) The entire outstanding debt amortisation is  scheduled within 85%
3
of the economic life of the  project as prescribed in paragraph 8 (iii) above;
If  the Initial Debt Facility or Refinancing Debt Facility becomes NPA at any  stage, further refinancing should stop and the bank which holds the loan when  it becomes NPA, would be required to recognise the loan as such and make  necessary provisions as required under the extant regulations. Once the account  comes out of NPA status, it will be eligible for refinancing in terms of these  instructions;
Banks  may determine the pricing of the loans at each stage of sanction of the Initial  Debt Facility or Refinancing Debt Facility, commensurate with the risk at each  phase of the loan, and such pricing should not be below the Base Rate of the  bank;
Banks should secure their interest by way of proper documentation and  security creation, etc.;
Banks will be initially allowed to count the  cash flows from periodic amortisations of loans as also the bullet repayment of  the outstanding debt at the end of each refinancing period for their  asset-liability management; however, with experience gained, banks will be  required in due course to conduct behavioural studies of cash flows in such amortisation  of loans and plot them accordingly in ALM statements;
Banks should recognise from a risk management  perspective that there will be a probability that the loan will not be  refinanced by other banks, and should take this into account when estimating  liquidity needs as well as stress scenarios. Further, unless the part or full  refinancing by other banks is clearly identified, the cash flows from such  refinancing should not be taken into account for computing liquidity ratios.  Similarly, once committed, the refinancing bank should take into account such  cash flows for computing their liquidity ratios; and
Banks should have a Board approved policy for  such financing.
9. The above structure will apply to new loans  to infrastructure projects and core industries projects sanctioned after the  date of this circular. Further, our instructions on ‘take-out finance’  (circular dated February 29, 2000) and   ‘transfer of borrowal accounts’ (circular dated May 10, 2012) will cease  to be applicable on any loan to infrastructure and core industries projects  sanctioned under these instructions. RBI will review the instructions at  periodic intervals.
Yours faithfully,

A relaxation of only 5% of initial economic life is  provided in case of delay in achieving DCCO from the 80% ceiling of  amortisation of project debt prescribed in paragraph 8(iii). Banks may factor  the same while determining Original Amortisation Schedule.
