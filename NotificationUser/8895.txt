All banks having Currency  Chest
Madam/  Dear Sir,
CCTV Coverage of all  cash handling operations in Currency Chests
It has been reported by one of our Regional Offices that  the work of packing of soiled note remittance by a currency chest was undertaken  outside the strong room/vault which resulted in CCTV failing to capture the operations of packing of remittance. While taking  over the remittance by our office, shortage was detected. Subsequent preliminary enquiry has revealed  that the Potdar has not accompanied the remittance.
2. In this  connection, we invite attention to the instructions contained in our Circular  DCM (CC) No.5622/03.39.01/2007-08 dated January 31, 2008, in which we had  advised the banks, inter-alia, that coverage of CCTVs surveillance should also  cover all cash operations in the vaults / strong rooms and other cash handling  areas to identify any mischief / irregularity and also to the Memorandum on the  procedure to be followed in connection with opening of the Currency Chests  issued to the banks in which, we had advised the banks that Potdar from the  Chest Remitting bank should accompany soiled note remittance.
3. We reiterate  that all the instructions on remittance of soiled notes issued from time to  time must be followed meticulously.
4. Please acknowledge receipt to our Regional Office under  whose jurisdiction your bank functions.
Yours faithfully,
(D.  Asainathan)
Deputy  General Manager
