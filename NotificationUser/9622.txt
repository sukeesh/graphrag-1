In order to ensure prompt reporting of the tax collection figures for the year ending March 2015, the following procedure may be adopted. In the normal course, the settlement figures with Reserve Bank of India, Central Accounts Section (CAS) are captured in the daily reporting of agency banks to them while the pipeline residual transactions are reported till April 15, 2015.
In addition to the above, agency banks are advised to provide the residual figures separately for MIS purpose as per format given in the
