Madam/Dear Sir
GUIDELINES FOR RELIEF MEASURES BY BANKS
IN AREAS AFFECTED BY NATURAL CALAMITIES
Please refer to our
Master Circular FIDD.No.FSD.BC.01/05.10.001/2015-16 dated July 1, 2015
containing ‘Guidelines for Relief Measures by Banks in Areas affected by Natural Calamities’. Considering that Government of India has, vide their notification dated April 8, 2015, reduced the criteria of crop loss from 50 percent to 33 percent for providing input subsidy (compensation) to the farmers, the above guidelines have been reviewed.
2. It has been decided to allow State Level Bankers’ Committees/District Level Consultative Committees/banks to take a view on rescheduling of loans if the crop loss is 33% or more. Banks may allow a maximum period of repayment of up to 2 years (including the moratorium period of 1 year) if the loss is between 33% and 50%. If the crop loss is 50% or more, the restructured period for repayment may be extended to a maximum of 5 years (including the moratorium period of one year). The relevant paras (5.5, 5.6, 6.3 and 6.7) of the guidelines have been suitably amended and the updated Master Circular has been placed on our website (
www.rbi.org.in
) simultaneously.
3. Please acknowledge receipt.
Yours faithfully
