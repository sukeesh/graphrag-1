Dear  Sir / Madam
Inoperative  Accounts
Please  refer to Paragraph 2(iv) of our
Circular  UBD.BPD.(PCB).Cir.No.9/13.01.000/2008-09 dated September 1, 2008
on  Unclaimed Deposits / Inoperative Accounts in Banks in terms of which a savings  as well as current account should be treated as inoperative / dormant if there  are no transactions in the account for over a period of two years. Further, in  terms of
Paragraph 2(vi),
for the purpose of classifying an account as  inoperative, both the types of transactions i.e. debit as well as credit  transactions induced at the instance of customers as well as third party should  be considered.
2.  There may be instances where the customer has given a mandate for crediting  dividend on shares to Savings Bank account and there are no other operations in  the Savings Bank account. Some doubts have arisen whether such an account is to  be treated as inoperative account after two years.
3.  In this connection, we clarify that since dividend on shares is credited to  Savings Bank accounts as per the mandate of the customer, the same should be  treated as a customer induced transaction. As such, the account should be  treated as operative account as long as the dividend is credited to the Savings  Bank account. The Savings Bank account can be treated as inoperative account  only after two years from the date of the last credit entry of the dividend,  provided there is no other customer induced transaction.
Yours  faithfully,
(A  K Bera)
Principal  Chief General Manager
