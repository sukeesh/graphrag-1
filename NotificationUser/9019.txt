Dear Sir/ Madam,
Lending against Gold  Jewellery
Please refer to our
circulars  RPCD.CO.No.RRB.BC.64/03.05.34/2005-06 dated February 27, 2006
and
RPCD.CO.RF.BC.No.67 /07.40.06/2005-06  dated March 9, 2006
on ‘Advances against Gold Ornaments and Jewellery.’
2. As a prudential measure, it has been decided to prescribe  a Loan to Value (LTV) Ratio of not exceeding 75 per cent for banks’ lending  against Gold jewellery (including bullet repayment loans against pledge of gold  jewellery) for the purpose of medical expenses and meeting unforeseen liabilities.  Therefore, henceforth loans sanctioned by RRBs and StCBs/CCBs should not exceed  75 per cent of the value of gold ornaments and jewellery.
3. In order to standardize the valuation and make it more  transparent to the borrower, it has been decided that gold jewellery accepted  as security / collateral will have to be valued at the average of the closing  price of 22 carat gold for the preceding 30 days as quoted by the India Bullion  and Jewellers Association Ltd. [formerly known as the Bombay Bullion  Association Ltd. (BBA)]. If the gold is of purity less than 22 carats, the bank  should translate the collateral into 22 carat and value the exact grams of the  collateral. In other words, jewellery of lower purity of gold shall be valued  proportionately.
4. It is reiterated that RRBs and  StCBs/CCBs should continue to observe necessary and usual safeguards and also  have a suitable policy for lending against gold jewellery with the approval of  their Boards of Directors.
Yours faithfully,
(A. Udgata)
