Dear Sir,
Non-Agriculture Loans  against Gold Ornaments and Jewellery
In  response to suggestions from banks and with a view to ensuring a level playing  field among various market participants, it has been decided to permit bullet  repayment of loans extended against pledge of gold ornaments and jewellery for other  than agricultural purposes subject to the following guidelines:
(i)  The amount of loan sanctioned should not exceed Rs 1.00 lakh at any point of  time.
(ii)  The period of the loan shall not exceed 12 months from the date of sanction.
(iii)  Interest will be charged to the account at monthly rests but will become due  for payment along with principal only at the maturity.
(iv) Banks  should prescribe a minimum margin to be maintained in case of such loans and  accordingly, fix the loan limit taking into account the market value of the  security (gold ornaments), expected price fluctuations, interest that will  accrue during the tenure of the loan etc.
(v)  The account would be classified as Non-Performing Asset (sub-standard category)  even before the due date of repayment, if the prescribed margin is not  maintained.
(vi) Banks  shall recognise interest income on such loans in their profit and loss account  only on collection.
(vii)  Such loans shall also be governed by other extant norms pertaining to income  recognition, asset classification and provisioning which shall be applicable  once the principal and interest become overdue.
Yours faithfully,
(Chandan Sinha)
