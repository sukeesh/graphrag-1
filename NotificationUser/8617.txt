The Chairman /  Managing Director
All Public &  Private Sector Scheduled Commercial Banks
Dear Sir
Union Budget -  2013-14
Interest Subvention Scheme
As directed by the Government of India and in pursuance  of the budget announcement made by the Finance Minister relating to the  Interest Subvention Scheme 2013-14, Interest  subvention of 2 % p.a. will be made available to Public Sector Banks (PSBs) and  Private Sector Scheduled Commercial Banks (in respect of loans given by their  rural and semi-urban branches) on their own funds used for short-term crop  loans up to Rs.3,00,000/- per farmer provided the lending institutions make  available short term credit at the ground level at 7% per annum to  farmers. This amount of interest  subvention will be calculated on the crop loan amount from the date of its  disbursement/drawal up to the date of actual repayment of the crop loan by the  farmer or up to the due date of the loan fixed by the banks whichever is  earlier, subject to a maximum period of one year.
2. Besides, additional interest subvention @3% will be  available to the prompt paying farmers from the date of disbursement of the  crop loan up to the actual date of repayment by farmers or up to the due date  fixed by bank for repayment of crop loan, whichever is earlier, subject to a  maximum period of one year from the date of disbursement. This also implies  that the prompt paying farmers would get short term crop loans @4% per annum  during the year 2013-14. This benefit would not accrue to those farmers who repay  after one year of availing such loans.
3. Further, in respect of KCC Scheme, the GoI  has clarified that loans granted only for categories at S.No. (i) and (ii) out  of the following six categories are covered under the Interest Subvention  Scheme, which should be computed and segregated accordingly for claiming  interest subvention :
To meet the short term credit  requirements for cultivation of crops
Post-harvest expenses
Produce Marketing loan
Consumption requirement of  farmer household
Working capital for maintenance  of farm assets and activities allied to agriculture, like dairy animals, inland  fishery, etc.
Investment credit requirement  for agriculture and allied activities like pump sets, sprayers, dairy animals,  etc.
4. The benefits of interest subvention  will also be available to small and marginal farmers having Kisan Credit Card  for a further period of up to six months post harvest on the same rate as  available to crop loan against negotiable warehouse receipt for keeping their  produce in warehouses.
5. Banks may give adequate publicity to the above scheme so  that the farmers can avail the benefits.
6. It is also advised as under:-
i) Claims in respect of 2 % interest subvention  and 3 % additional interest subvention may be submitted in

(enclosed herewith) respectively to the Chief General Manager, Rural Planning  and Credit Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Shahid Bhagat  Singh Road, Fort, Mumbai - 400001.
