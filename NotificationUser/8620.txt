To,
The Chief Executive Officer
All Urban Co-operative Banks
Dear Sir / Madam,
Timely Issue of TDS Certificate to Customers
It has been  brought to our notice that some banks are not providing TDS Certificate in Form  16A to their customers in time, causing inconvenience to customers in filing  income-tax returns in time.
2. With  a view to protecting the interests of depositors and for rendering better  customer service, urban co-operative banks (UCBs) are advised to provide to  their customers from whose deposit accounts income tax has been deducted at  source, TDS Certificate in Form 16A. UCBs are also advised to put in place a  system that will enable them to provide Form 16A to their customers within the  time-frame prescribed under the Income Tax Rules.
3. This advice is issued under Section 36 (1) (a)  of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) (10  of 1949).
Yours faithfully,
(Scenta Joy)
Deputy General Manager
