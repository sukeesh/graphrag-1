Madam/ Dear Sir,
Kisan Credit Card Scheme - Eligibility criteria for farmers engaged in fisheries/ aquaculture
Please refer to Para 3.1.1.2 of our
circular FIDD.CO.FSD.BC.12/05.05.010/2018-19 dated February 04, 2019
on Kisan Credit Card (KCC) Scheme: Working Capital for Animal Husbandry and Fisheries. It has been brought to our notice that licensing/authorisation related requirements pertaining to fishing/aquaculture in inland water bodies vary across states. Accordingly, the eligibility criteria for inland fisheries and aquaculture under Para 3.1.1.2 of the circular stand modified as follows:
The beneficiaries must own or lease any fisheries related assets such as ponds, tanks, open water bodies, raceways, hatcheries, rearing units, boats, nets and such other fishing gear as the case may be and possess necessary authorisation/certification as may be applicable in respective states for fish farming and fishing related activities and for any other state specific fisheries and allied activities.
2. All other terms and conditions of the scheme remain unchanged.
Yours faithfully,
(Nisha Nambiar)
