Targets and Classification) Directions, 2020
In exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 21 and 35A read with Section 56 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the Reserve Bank of India, being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient in the public interest so to do, hereby, issues the Directions hereinafter specified.
CHAPTER – I
PRELIMINARY
1.
Short Title and Commencement
1.1 These Directions shall be called the Reserve Bank of India (Priority Sector Lending – Targets and Classification) Directions, 2020.
1.2 These Directions shall come into effect on the day they are placed on the official website of the Reserve Bank of India.
2.
Applicability
The provisions of these Directions shall apply to every Commercial Bank [including Regional Rural Bank (RRB), Small Finance Bank (SFB), Local Area Bank] and Primary (Urban) Co-operative Bank (UCB) other than Salary Earners’ Bank.
3.
Definitions/ Clarifications
3.1 In these Directions, unless the context otherwise requires, the terms herein shall bear the meanings assigned to them below:
‘Urban Co-operative Bank’ or ‘UCB’ means a Primary Co-operative Bank as defined under Section 5(ccv) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 read with Section 56 of the Act.
“On-lending” means loans sanctioned by banks to eligible intermediaries for onward lending for creation of priority sector assets. The average maturity of priority sector assets thus created by the eligible intermediaries should be co-terminus with maturity of the bank loan.
Contingent liabilities/off-balance sheet items do not form part of priority sector achievement. However, foreign banks with less than 20 branches have an option to reckon the Credit Equivalent of Off-Balance Sheet Exposures (CEOBE) extended to borrowers for eligible priority sector activities for achievement of priority sector target, subject to the condition that the CEOBE (both priority sector and non-priority sector excluding interbank exposure) should be added to the Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) in the denominator for computation of PSL targets.
Off-balance sheet interbank exposures are excluded for computing CEOBE for the priority sector targets.
The term “all-inclusive interest” includes interest (effective annual interest), processing fees and service charges.
3.2
All other expressions, unless defined herein, shall have the same meaning as has been assigned to them under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 or the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 or any statutory modification or re-enactment thereto or as used in commercial parlance, as the case may be.
3.3
Banks must ensure that loans extended under priority sector are for approved purposes and the end use is continuously monitored. The banks should put in place proper internal controls and systems in this regard.

6.4
While calculating Net Bank Credit as above, if banks subtract prudential write off at Corporate/Head Office level, it must be ensured that the credit to priority sector and all other sub-sectors so written off should also be subtracted category wise from priority sector and sub-target achievement. Wherever, investments or any other items which are treated as eligible for classification under priority sector target/sub-target achievement, the same should also form part of Adjusted Net Bank Credit.
6.5
All the banks have to adhere to the respective licencing guidelines and operating guidelines issued by the Department of Regulation, RBI and updated from time to time
7.
Adjustments for weights in PSL Achievement
To address regional disparities in the flow of priority sector credit at the district level, it was decided to rank districts on the basis of per capita credit flow to priority sector and build an incentive framework for districts with comparatively lower flow of credit and a dis-incentive framework for districts with comparatively higher flow of priority sector credit. With effect from FY 2024-25, a higher weight (125%) shall be assigned to the incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively lower (per capita PSL less than ₹9,000), and a lower weight (90%) will be assigned for incremental priority sector credit in the identified districts where the credit flow is comparatively higher (per capita PSL greater than ₹42,000). The list of both categories of districts is given in
Annexes IA
and
IB
and will be valid up to FY 2026-27. The districts other than those mentioned in Annexes IA and IB will continue to have existing weightage of 100%.
The banks should continue to report the actual outstanding amount in QPSA returns as hitherto. Adjustments for weights to incremental PSL credit will be done by RBI, based on reporting of district wise credit flow to FIDD, CO through the ADEPT database. RRBs, UCBs, LABs and foreign banks (including WoS) would be exempted from adjustments of weights in PSL achievement due to their currently limited area of operation/catering to a niche segment.
