2. In order to encourage NBFCs to securitise/assign their eligible assets, it has been decided to relax the Minimum Holding Period (MHP) requirement for originating NBFCs, in respect of loans of original maturity above 5 years, to receipt of repayment of six monthly instalments or two quarterly instalments (as applicable), subject to the following prudential requirement:
Minimum Retention Requirement (MRR) for such securitisation/assignment transactions shall be 20% of the book value of the loans being securitised/20% of the cash flows from the assets assigned.
3. The above dispensation shall be applicable to securitisation/assignment transactions carried out during a period of six months from the date of issuance of this circular. Other terms and conditions of the above referred Directions remain the same.
Yours faithfully
