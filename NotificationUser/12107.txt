Submission of returns under Section 31 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) – Extension of time
In terms of Section 31 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (“the Act”), read with Section 56 of the Act, accounts and balance sheet referred to in Section 29 of the Act together with the auditor's report shall be published in the prescribed manner and three copies thereof shall be furnished as returns to the Reserve Bank within three months from the end of the period to which they refer. In terms of Section 31 read with Section 56 (t) (ii) of BR Act, State Co-operative Banks and Central Co-operative Banks are also required to submit these statements as returns to the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD).
2. As many of the Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs), State Co-operative Banks and Central Co-operative Banks are facing difficulties in finalising their Annual Accounts due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it is considered necessary to allow more time for submission of the aforesaid return during the current period.
3. In view of the above, Reserve Bank hereby extends the said period of three months for the furnishing of the returns under Section 31 of the Act for the financial year ended on March 31, 2021, by a further period of three months. Accordingly, all UCBs, State Co-operative Banks and Central Co-operative Banks shall ensure submission of the aforesaid returns to Reserve Bank on or before September 30, 2021. The State Co-operative Banks and Central Co-operative Banks shall also ensure submission of the aforesaid returns to NABARD on or before September 30, 2021.
Yours faithfully
