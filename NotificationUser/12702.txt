10
.
3.3 EWS / RFA Framework for Credit Facilities / Loan Accounts
3.3.1 Development of EWS System: The EWS system shall be comprehensive and designed to include both the quantitative and qualitative indicators to make the framework robust and effective. The broad indicators which the EWS system may illustratively capture could be based on the transactional data of accounts, financial performance of borrowers, market intelligence, conduct of the borrowers, etc.
3.3.2 Data Analytics and Market Intelligence (MI) Unit: Banks shall set up a dedicated Data Analytics and MI Unit keeping in view their size, complexity, business mix, risk profile, etc. Such Unit shall facilitate collection and processing of relevant information to enable an early detection and prevention of potentially fraudulent activities.
3.3.3 Generation of EWS alert(s) / trigger(s) shall necessitate examination whether the account needs to be red flagged and consequently, investigation from potential fraud angle.
3.3.4 An account meeting the CRILC reporting threshold
11
by the reporting entity, once red flagged, shall be reported to the Reserve Bank within seven days of being red flagged.
3.4 EWS Framework for other banking / non-credit related transactions

Further, the effectiveness of EWS system shall be tested periodically.
3.4.2 The design and specification of EWS system shall be robust and resilient to ensure that integrity of system is maintained, personal and financial data of customers are secure and transaction monitoring for prevention / detection of potential fraud is on real-time basis
13
. Banks shall remain vigilant in monitoring transactions / unusual activities, specifically in the non-KYC compliant and money mule accounts etc., to contain unauthorised / fraudulent transactions and to prevent misuse of banking channel.
3.4.3 The Data Analytics & MI Unit or other dedicated analytics set up in banks shall extensively monitor and analyse other banking / non-credit related transactions, more specifically the transactions through digital platforms and applications, in order to identify unusual patterns and activities which could alert the bank timely in initiating appropriate measures towards prevention of fraudulent activities.
3.5 Banks shall put in place / suitably upgrade their existing EWS system within six months from the date of issuance of these Directions.
CHAPTER IV
4. Credit facility / Loan account classified as Red-flagged Account and Reporting of Fraud

14
or an internal audit as per their Board approved Policy, for further investigation in such accounts.
4.1.1 Banks shall frame a policy on engagement of external auditors covering aspects such as due diligence, competency and track record of the auditors, among others. Further, the contractual agreement with the auditors shall, inter alia, contain suitable clauses on timeline for completion of the audit and submission of audit report to the bank within a specified time limit, as approved by the Board.
4.1.2 The loan agreement with the borrower shall contain clauses for conduct of such audit at the behest of lender(s) consequent upon red flagging of the account. In cases where the audit report submitted remains inconclusive or is delayed due to non-cooperation by the borrower, banks shall conclude on status of the account as a fraud or otherwise based on the material available on their record and their own internal investigation / assessment in such cases
15
.
4.1.3 The decision to classify any account, either standard or NPA, as a red-flagged account shall be at the individual bank level and such bank(s) shall report the status of the account on the Reserve Bank’s CRILC platform
16
immediately (not later than seven days from date of classification as red-flagged account).
4.1.4 The bank (in case of sole lending) or the individual banks (in case of multiple banking arrangement or consortium lending) shall ensure that the principles of natural justice
17
are strictly adhered to before classifying / declaring an account as fraud.
4.1.5 Once an account has been red-flagged, the entire process of classification of the account as fraud or removal of red-flagged status shall ordinarily be completed within 180 days from the date of first reporting of the account as red-flagged on the CRILC platform. Cases remaining in red-flagged status beyond 180 days shall be reported to the SCBMF for review with adequate reasoning / justification thereof. Such cases shall also be subject to supervisory review by the Reserve Bank.
4.1.6 In case an account is identified as a fraud by any bank, the borrowal accounts of other group companies
18
, in which one or more promoter(s) / whole-time director(s) are common, shall also be subjected to examination by banks concerned from fraud angle under these Directions.
4.1.7 In cases where Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) have suo moto initiated investigation involving a borrower account, bank/s shall immediately red-flag the account and follow the usual process for classification of account as fraud and complete the same within the stipulated period as specified at Para 4.1.5 above.
4.2 Independent confirmation from the third-party service providers including professionals
4.2.1 Banks place reliance on various third-party service providers as part of pre-sanction appraisal and post-sanction monitoring. Therefore, banks may incorporate necessary terms and conditions in their agreements with third-party service providers to hold them accountable in situations where wilful negligence / malpractice by them is found to be a causative factor for fraud.
4.2.2 Banks shall, after complying with the principles of natural justice, report to Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) the details of such third parties or professionals involved in frauds. IBA would, in turn, prepare caution lists of such third parties for circulation among the banks.
4.3 Staff Accountability
4.3.1 Banks shall initiate and complete the examination of staff accountability in all fraud cases in a time-bound manner in accordance with their internal policy.
4.3.2. PSBs and AIFIs shall conduct examination of staff accountability as per the guidelines issued by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).

19
constituted by the CVC.
4.3.3 In cases involving very senior executives of the bank (MD & CEO / Executive Director / Executives of equivalent rank)
20
, the ACB shall initiate examination of their accountability and place it before the Board. However, in case of PSBs and AIFIs, such cases shall also be referred to the ABBFF.
4.4 Penal Measures
4.4.1 Persons / Entities classified and reported as fraud by banks and also Entities and Persons associated
21
with such Entities, shall be debarred from raising of funds and / or seeking additional credit facilities from financial entities regulated by RBI, for a period of five years from the date of full repayment of the defrauded amount / settlement amount agreed upon in case of a compromise settlement.
4.4.2 Lending to such Persons / Entities, being commercial decisions, the lending banks shall have the sole discretion to entertain or decline such requests for credit facilities after the expiry of the mandatory cooling period as mentioned at Para 4.4.1 above.
4.5 Treatment of accounts under Resolution
4.5.1 In case an entity classified as fraud has subsequently undergone a resolution either under IBC or under the resolution framework of RBI
22
resulting in a change in the management and control of the entity / business enterprise, the bank shall examine whether the entity shall continue to remain classified as fraud or the classification as fraud could be removed after implementation of the Resolution Plan under IBC or aforesaid prudential framework. This would, however, be without prejudice to the continuance of criminal action against erstwhile promoter(s) / director(s) / person(s) who were in charge and responsible for the management of the affairs of the entity / business enterprise.
4.5.2 The penal measures as detailed in Para 4.4 shall not be applicable to entities / business enterprises after implementation of the Resolution Plan under IBC or aforesaid prudential framework.
