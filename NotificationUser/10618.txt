Dear Madam / Sir,
Aadhaar-based Authentication for Card Present Transactions
A reference is invited to our
circular dated November 26, 2013 on Security and Risk Mitigation Measures for Card Present Transactions
wherein the banks were advised that all new card present infrastructure has to be enabled for both EMV Chip and PIN and Aadhaar (biometric validation) acceptance.
2. With the substantial increase in number of Aadhaar card holders in the country, we reiterate our above mentioned instructions and advise banks to ensure that all new card acceptance infrastructure deployed with effect from
January 1, 2017
are enabled for processing payment transactions using Aadhaar-based biometric authentication also.
3. This directive is issued under Section 10(2) read with Section 18 of Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 (Act 51 of 2007).
4. Please acknowledge the receipt of this circular.
Yours faithfully,
(Nanda S. Dave)
Chief General Manager
