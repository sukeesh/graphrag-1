and
FMRD.DIRD.02/14.03.007/2014-15 dated December 24, 2014
on the captioned subject.
2. In terms of
circular IDMD.PCD.06/14.03.07/2014-15 dated September 30, 2014
, scheduled commercial banks and PDs were permitted to execute the sale leg of short sale transactions in the OTC market, in addition to the NDS-OM platform. However, presently short sale is not allowed between CSGL account holder (custodian) and its gilt account holder (GAH).
3. With a view to facilitate retail participation in Government securities and enhance liquidity in the Government securities market, it was announced in the
Fourth Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2015-16
to permit short sale by a custodian to its GAH.
4. Accordingly it has been decided as under:
A custodian may undertake a short sale transaction with its GAH within the permissible short sale limits
A custodian may put through a cover transaction with a GAH to square a short sale transaction in the related security undertaken with a market participant other than its GAH/s.
5. The custodians will have to tag the deal as short sale or cover while reporting the same to NDS-OM. Such short sale or cover deals will be reckoned in the computation of the short sale limit utilization.
6. At the time of settlement at Reserve Bank of India, custodians will have to ensure adequate balance in their SGL failing which it will be treated as a SGL bounce for the custodian with consequent penalties as prescribed in RBI
circular IDMD.PCD.06/14.03.07/2014-15 dated September 30, 2014
as amended from time to time.
7. Banks and PDs have to put in place appropriate systems and internal controls including 100% audit of such transactions on daily basis to ensure adherence to the regulatory limits prescribed for short sale in Government securities from time to time.
8. Eligible entities should submit a duly certified report of the daily security-wise short sale position, as per the format given in
Annex
, to the Financial Markets Regulation Department, Reserve Bank of India, Mumbai on a monthly basis by the 10th of the succeeding month. The soft copy of the report may be
emailed
.
9. All other terms and conditions contained in the aforementioned circulars remain unchanged.
