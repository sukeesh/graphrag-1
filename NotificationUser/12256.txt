All collateral-free loans, irrespective of end use and mode of application/ processing/ disbursal (either through physical or digital channels), provided to low-income households, i.e., households having annual income up to ₹3,00,000, shall be considered as microfinance loans.
3.3
To ensure collateral-free nature of the microfinance loan, the loan shall not be linked with a lien on the deposit account of the borrower.

The REs shall have a board-approved policy to provide the flexibility of repayment periodicity on microfinance loans as per borrowers’ requirement.

Annex I
.

5.3
Existing loans, for which outflows on account of repayment of monthly loan obligations of a household as a percentage of the monthly household income exceed the limit of 50 per cent, shall be allowed to mature. However, in such cases, no new loans shall be provided to these households till the prescribed limit of 50 per cent is complied with.
5.4
Each RE shall provide timely and accurate data to the CICs and use the data available with them to ensure compliance with the level of indebtedness. Besides, the RE shall also ascertain the same from other sources such as declaration from the borrowers, their bank account statements and local enquiries.

Indicative Methodology for Household Income Assessment
1. For undertaking the income assessment of a low-income household, information related to following parameters may be captured by the lender:
(i) Parameters to capture household profile
a) Composition of the household
Number of earning members
Number of non-earning members
b) Type of accommodation (owned/ rented, etc.)
c) Availability of basic amenities (electricity, water, toilet, sewage, LPG connection, etc.)
d) Availability of other assets (land, livestock, vehicle, furniture, smartphone, electronic items, etc.)
(ii) Parameters to capture household income
a) Primary source of income
Sector of work (Agriculture & allied activities, trading, manufacturing, services, etc.)
Nature of work (Self-employed or salaried, regular or seasonal, etc.)
Frequency of income (daily/ weekly/ monthly)
Months/ days of employment over last one year
Self-reported monthly income
Average monthly income (to be derived from (iv) & (v) above)
b) Other sources of income
Remittance
Rent/ Lease
Pension
Government transfer
Scholarship
Others (specify details)
c) The income assessment as above may be carried out for all earning members with respect to all sources (primary or secondary) of income. While assessing income of all members from all sources, it may be ensured that there is no double counting of income such as counting of salary income of one migrant member also as remittance income for the household.
d) While the income computation may be done on a monthly basis, the income assessment for all members and sources may be carried out over a period of minimum one year to ascertain the stability of the household income.
(iii) Parameters to capture household expenses
Regular monthly expenses (food, utilities, transport, house/ shop rent, clothing, regular medical costs, school/ college fees, etc.)
Irregular expenses over last one year (medical expenses, house renovation, purchase of household goods, functions, etc.)
2. Self-reported income at 1(ii) above may be corroborated with the profile of household at 1(i) and household expenses at 1(iii). Further, household income may also be verified from other sources (bank account statements of the borrowers, group members, other references in the vicinity, etc.).
