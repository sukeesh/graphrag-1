Madam / Sir,
Security Measures for ATMs
As stated in para 15 of the
monetary policy statement dated October 04, 2016
, the Bank had constituted a Committee on Currency Movement (CCM) [Chair: Shri D.K. Mohanty, Executive Director] to review the entire gamut of security of treasure in transit. The recommendations of the Committee have been examined and certain measures aimed at mitigating risks in ATM operations and enhancing security, are listed below:
All ATMs shall be operated for cash replenishment only with digital One Time Combination (OTC) locks.
All ATMs shall be grouted to a structure (wall, pillar, floor, etc.) by September 30, 2019, except for ATMs installed in highly secured premises such as airports, etc. which have adequate CCTV coverage and are guarded by state / central security personnel.
Banks may also consider rolling out a comprehensive e-surveillance mechanism at the ATMs to ensure timely alerts and quick response.
2. The above measures shall be implemented in addition to the existing instructions, practices and guidance issued by the Reserve Bank of India and law enforcement agencies. Non-adherence of timelines / non-observance shall attract regulatory action including levy of penalty.
Yours faithfully,
(Ajay Michyari)
Chief General Manager-in- Charge
