Dear Sir/Madam,
Timely Issue of TDS Certificate to Customers
It has been brought to our notice that, some  banks are not providing TDS Certificate in Form 16A to their customers in time,  causing inconvenience to customers in filing income-tax returns timely.
2. The matter has been examined and with a view  to protect interest of the depositors  and for rendering better customer service, banks are advised to provide to their customers from whose income tax has  been deducted at source, TDS Certificate in Form 16A. Banks are advised to put  in place systems that will enable them to provide Form 16A to the customers  within the time-frame prescribed under the Income Tax Rules. Banks should avoid  waiting till the last moment.
3. This advice is issued under Section 36 (1)  (a) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949).
Yours faithfully,
(Rajesh Verma)
Chief General Manager
