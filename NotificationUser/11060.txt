Guidelines on collateral free lending for micro and small units issued from time to time shall apply. Banks shall adhere to the instructions on reporting GCC data as issued by RBI from time to time.
4.4 Streamlining flow of credit to Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) for facilitating timely and adequate credit flow during their ‘Life Cycle’:
In order to provide timely financial support to Micro and Small enterprises facing financial difficulties during their ‘Life Cycle’, detailed guidelines were issued to banks vide
circular FIDD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.60/06.02.31/2015-16 dated August 27, 2015
on the captioned subject.
In accordance with the guidelines, banks shall review and tune their lending policies to the MSE sector by incorporating therein the following provisions so as to facilitate timely and adequate availability of credit to viable MSE borrowers especially during the need of funds in unforeseen circumstances:
To extend standby credit facility in case of term loans.
Additional working capital to meet with emergent needs of MSE units.
Mid-term review of the regular working capital limits, where banks are convinced that changes in the demand pattern of MSE borrowers require increasing the existing credit limits of the MSEs, every year based on the actual sales of the previous year.
Timeline for credit decisions for loans up to ₹25 lakh to units in the MSE borrowers shall not be more than 14 working days. For loans above the aforementioned limit, timelines shall be as per the Board approved sanction time norms. All credit related information pertaining to MSMEs including timelines for credit decisions, indicative document checklist etc., shall be displayed under a separate tab prominently on the bank's website.
4.5 Debt Restructuring Mechanism for MSMEs
i) Banks are advised to follow the guidelines/instructions on debt restructuring pertaining to MSMEs contained in the ‘
Master Circular - Prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances
’ as updated from time to time.
ii) All commercial banks are also advised in terms of our
circular RPCD.SME&NFS.BC.No.102/06.04.01/2008-09 dated May 4, 2009
to do the following:
put in place loan policies governing extension of credit facilities, Restructuring/Rehabilitation policy for revival of potentially viable sick units / enterprises (now read with guidelines on
Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises issued on March 17, 2016
) and non- discretionary One Time Settlement scheme for recovery of non- performing loans for the MSE sector, with the approval of the Board of Directors and
give wide publicity to the One-Time settlement scheme implemented by them, by placing it on the bank’s website and through other possible modes of dissemination. They may allow reasonable time to the borrowers to submit the application and also make payment of the dues in order to extend the benefits of the scheme to eligible borrowers.
implement recommendations with regard to timely and adequate flow of credit to the MSE sector.
4.6 Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of MSMEs
The Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Government of India, vide their Gazette Notification dated May 29, 2015 had notified a ‘Framework for Revival and Rehabilitation of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises’ to provide a simpler and faster mechanism to address the stress in the accounts of MSMEs and to facilitate the promotion and development of MSMEs. After carrying out certain changes in the captioned Framework in consultation with the Government of India, Ministry of MSME so as to make it compatible with the existing regulatory guidelines on ‘Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances’ issued to banks by RBI, the guidelines on the captioned Framework along with operating instructions were issued to banks on March 17, 2016. The revival and rehabilitation of MSME units having loan limits up to ₹25 crore would be undertaken under this Framework. The revised Framework supersedes our earlier Guidelines on Rehabilitation of Sick Micro and Small Enterprises issued vide our
circular RPCD.CO.MSME& NFS.BC.40/06.02.31/2012-2013 dated November 1, 2012
, except those relating to Reliefs and Concessions for Rehabilitation of Potentially Viable Units and One Time Settlement, mentioned in the said circular.
The salient features of the Framework are as under:
Before a loan account of an MSME turns into a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), banks or creditors should identify incipient stress in the account by creating three sub-categories under the Special Mention Account (SMA) category as given in the Framework
Any MSME borrower may also voluntarily initiate proceedings under this Framework
Committee approach to be adopted for deciding corrective action plan
Timelines have been fixed for taking various decisions under the Framework
4.7 Structured Mechanism for monitoring the credit growth to the MSE sector
Banks shall put in place a structured mechanism to monitor the entire gamut of credit related issues pertaining to the MSE sector. Accordingly, banks shall implement the following:
Credit Proposal Tracking System (CPTS): Banks shall put in place a CPTS/ equivalent tracking mechanism to facilitate central registration and a system of e-tracking of all MSME loan applications. This mechanism shall automatically generate an acknowledgement of the application, having a unique application serial number for both physical and online applications. Further, it shall also be ensured that the acknowledgement and status of the application is sent automatically to the applicants.
Indicative check list of documents: Banks shall furnish the MSME borrowers with an indicative checklist of documents required for processing the loan application at the time of applying for the loan.
Monitoring the loan application disposal process: Banks shall monitor the loan application disposal process and pendency beyond sanction time norms at appropriate levels on a quarterly basis. The position in this regard shall be displayed by banks on their websites in the format specified in (
Annex I
) within one month from the end of the preceding quarter.
Reasons for rejection of loan applications: Banks shall, within the Board approved sanction time norms, convey to the MSME borrowers in writing the main reason/reasons which, in the opinion of the bank after due consideration, have led to rejection of the loan applications.
Comprehensive Performance MIS: Banks shall implement a system-driven comprehensive performance management information system (MIS) at branches and supervisory levels (region, zone, head office). The Performance should be critically evaluated on a regular basis. The credit flow to the sector shall also be reviewed by the Board of the banks at periodic intervals.
Detailed guidelines were issued to the scheduled commercial banks vide our
circular RPCD. MSME&NFS.BC.No.74/06.02.31/2012-13 dated May 9, 2013
.
Chapter - V
5. Institutional arrangements
5.1 Specialised MSME branches
Public sector banks are advised to open at least one specialised branch in each district. Further, banks have been permitted to categorise their general banking branches having 60% or more of their advances to MSME sector as specialized MSME branches in order to encourage them to open more specialised MSME branches for providing better service to this sector as a whole. As per the policy package announced by the Government of India for stepping up credit to MSME sector, the public sector banks would ensure specialized MSME branches in identified clusters/centres with preponderance of small enterprises to enable the entrepreneurs to have easy access to the bank credit and to equip bank personnel to develop requisite expertise. Though their core competence will be utilized for extending finance and other services to MSME sector, they will have operational flexibility to extend finance/render other services to other sectors/borrowers. Banks may take care to train the officials posted in such branches appropriately.
5.2 Empowered Committee on MSMEs
As part of the announcement made by the Union Finance Minister, Empowered Committees on MSMEs are constituted at the Regional Offices of Reserve Bank of India, under the Chairmanship of the Regional Directors with the representatives of SLBC Convenor, senior level officers from two banks having predominant share in MSME financing in the state, representative of SIDBI Regional Office, the Director of MSME or Industries of the State Government, one or two senior level representatives from the MSME Associations in the state, and a senior level officer from SFC/SIDC as members. The Committee would meet periodically and review the progress in MSME financing as also revival and rehabilitation of stressed Micro, Small and Medium units. It would also coordinate with other banks/financial institutions and the state government in removing bottlenecks, if any, to ensure smooth flow of credit to the sector. The committees may decide the need to have similar committees at cluster/district levels.
5.3 Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI)
BCSBI in collaboration with the Indian Banks' Association (IBA), Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and member banks had evolved the ‘Code of Bank's Commitment to Micro and Small Enterprises’ - which set minimum standards of banking practices for member banks to follow when they are dealing with Micro and Small Enterprises. The objective of the Code is to promote good banking practices, setting minimum standards for the adherents, increasing transparency, achieving higher operating standards and above all, promoting a cordial banker-customer relationship which would foster confidence in the banking system. The Code lays great emphasis on transparency and providing full information to the customer before a product or service is sold to him/her. Above all, member banks of BCSBI have voluntarily adopted the Code for implementation. While BCSBI has initiated the process of its dissolution, banks may continue to follow their commitments as hitherto under the Code of Bank's Commitment to Micro and Small Enterprises.
5.4 Micro and Small Enterprises Sector – The imperative of Financial Literacy and consultancy support
Keeping in view the high extent of financial exclusion in the MSME sector, it is imperative for banks that the excluded units are brought within the fold of the formal banking sector. The lack of financial literacy, operational skills, including accounting and finance, business planning etc. represent formidable challenge for MSE borrowers underscoring the need for facilitation by banks in these critical financial areas. Moreover, MSE enterprises are further handicapped in this regard by absence of scale and size. To effectively and decisively address these handicaps, scheduled commercial banks were advised vide our
circular RPCD.MSME & NFS.BC.No.20/06.02.31/2012-13 dated August 1, 2012
that they could either separately set up special cells at their branches, or vertically integrate this function in the Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs) set up by them, as per their comparative advantage. The bank staff should also be trained through customised training programs to meet the specific needs of the sector. Further, Financial Literacy Centres operated by Scheduled commercial Banks have been advised vide our
circular FIDD.FLC.BC.No.22/12.01.018/2016-17 dated March 2, 2017
to conduct target specific financial literacy camps, where one of the target groups is small entrepreneurs.
5.5 Cluster Approach
A cluster shall mean a cluster identified by the Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, Government of India or the respective State /UT Governments. SLBC/UTLBC Convenor banks shall display the list of these clusters on their portals and update them semi-annually as at end-March and end-September. The updated list of clusters identified by Ministry of MSME may be accessed from Ministry's official website, while information on clusters recognized by State Governments/Union Territories shall be obtained directly from the respective authorities.
i) The lead bank of a district shall promote 'credit-linkage' in all clusters located within the district. The initiatives under promotion of the credit-linkage, shall include but not be restricted to the following measures:
Assessing the credit requirements of the MSE units in the clusters and addressing their credit needs directly or facilitating their linkage with other banks operating in the area for credit proposals.
Creating awareness among the MSE units in the clusters regarding the importance of formal credit linkage through various forums including financial literacy camps.
Enabling coverage under various skill development initiatives in the district.
Focused attention and proactive measures to improve financial services in the underbanked clusters.
ii) The banks shall ensure that the credit needs of clusters are appropriately included in the exercise of preparation of branch/block level plans so that the same can be aggregated by lead banks to form the District Credit Plan (DCP) and subsequently by SLBC /UTLBC Convenor banks to prepare the Annual Credit Plan (ACP).
iii) The SLBC /UTLBC Convenor banks shall disclose the credit extended to clusters in the State/UT on their portal every quarter in the prescribed format (
Annex II
).
5.6 Delayed Payment
In the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED), Act 2006, the provisions of The Interest on Delayed Payment to Small Scale and Ancillary Industrial Undertakings Act, 1998, have been strengthened as under:
The buyer has to make payment to the supplier on or before the date agreed upon between him and the supplier in writing or, in case of no agreement, before the appointed day. The period agreed upon between the supplier and the buyer shall not exceed forty-five days from the date of acceptance or the day of deemed acceptance.
In case the buyer fails to make payment of the amount to the supplier, he shall be liable to pay compound interest with monthly rests to the supplier on the amount from the appointed day or, on the date agreed on, at three times of the Bank Rate notified by Reserve Bank.
For any goods supplied or services rendered by the supplier, the buyer shall be liable to pay the interest as advised at (ii) above.
In case of dispute with regard to any amount due, a reference shall be made to the Micro and Small Enterprises Facilitation Council, constituted by the respective State Government.
Further, banks are advised to fix sub-limits within the overall working capital limits to the large borrowers specifically for meeting the payment obligation in respect of purchases from MSMEs.
