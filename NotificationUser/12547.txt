Madam/Dear Sir,
Display at ATM sites – procedure for lodging of ATM complaints and uniform template for filing complaints
Kindly refer to our letters
DPSS No. 1316/02.10.02/2009-10 dated December 18, 2009
,
DPSS/CO/PD/2018/02.10.02/2009-10 dated March 19, 2010
, and
DPSS No. 2753/02.10.02/2009-10 dated June 15, 2010
, on the above subject. We had vide these letters advised banks to display the procedure and contact information, and also make available at all ATM sites, the uniform template circulated by Indian Banks Association (IBA) for lodging of complaints relating to ATM transactions.
2. A recent survey undertaken by RBI across the country has revealed that most of the banks, contrary to the reports submitted to RBI, have not ensured that availability of the complaint templates at their ATMs, which is a matter of concern.
3. In this connection you are requested to submit to Department of Payment and Settlement Systems, Central Office, Reserve Bank of India, by July 31, 2010, your bank’s Action Plan for implementing Reserve Bank’s circular on making available the complaint templates on all ATMs for lodging ATM related complaints. The contact details like name, phone no, e-mail address etc. of a senior functionary of your bank who will be coordinating this matter may also be intimated to us.
Yours faithfully,
(K. Sivaraman)
