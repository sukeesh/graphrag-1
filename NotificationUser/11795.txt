The first auction has failed.
The NBFC shall ensure that all other requirements of the extant directions regarding auction (prior notice, reserve price, arms-length relationship, disclosures, etc.) are met.
3. Non-adherence to the above conditions will attract strict enforcement action. The aforementioned Master Directions are being modified accordingly.
Yours faithfully,
