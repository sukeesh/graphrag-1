Dear Sir/Madam,
Kisan Vikas  Patra, 2014

copy of the Government of  India Notification No.G.S.R.705 (E) dated September 23, 2014

The  Government of India,  vide this Notification, has notified the Kisan Vikas Patra Rules, 2014, which  came into force with effect from September 23, 2014. As per the Notification,  the new Kisan Vikas Patra, 2014 Scheme, is required to be implemented through  the designated branches of the Agency banks, which have been authorized for  Public Provident Fund, 1968 (PPF, 1968) Scheme, together with Post Offices,  doing Savings Bank Work.
2. As per Rule 2(f) of the Kisan Vikas Patra Rules,  2014, authorized branches of the Agency banks, which are conducting PPF, 1968  business, are also eligible for conducting the Kisan Vikas Patra, 2014  business. Agency banks may follow the same reporting procedure as prescribed  for PPF, 1968 Scheme.
3. Details of accounting procedure for various  transactions under the scheme are under finalization. Pending this, transactions under the Scheme  may be classified as under:
Receipt  & Payment      :    8002  - Savings Certificates
00-107 - Post OfficeCertificates (New  Series)

Reporting of the KVP, 2014 transactions i.e.  receipt, payment, penalty, etc. may be directly credited to the Government  Account at Central Account Section, Reserve Bank of India,  Nagpur on daily  basis like the transactions of PPF, 1968, in order to have uniformity in  reporting, reconciliation and accounting.
5. The Agency banks are required to observe the  rules and regulations of the Scheme, and non-observance of rules and  regulations would attract penal action, including de-authorization of the  branch or bank. Pecuniary liabilities, if any, arising from such non-observance  shall be borne entirely by the bank.
6. You may, therefore, approach Central Account  Section, Reserve Bank of India,  Nagpur for  necessary arrangements to report KVP, 2014 transactions with immediate effect.

The respective Agency bank will place the indent  for the Kisan Vikas Patra certificates before the National Savings Institute  (NSI), Seminary Hills, Nagpur and pick up the required  stock of KVP certificates from India Security Press (ISP), Nasik.
