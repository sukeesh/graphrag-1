, State Co-operative Banks fulfilling the prescribed criteria are free to install off-site/mobile ATMs without prior approval from RBI.
2. With a view to providing operational freedom to banks, it is advised that Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks and State Co-operative Banks are now free to offer all their products and services through the ATM channels, provided the technology permits the same and adequate checks are put in place to prevent the channel from being misused to perpetrate frauds on the banks / other genuine customers.
