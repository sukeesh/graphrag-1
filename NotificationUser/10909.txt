Madam / Sir,
Liquidity Adjustment Facility – Repo and Reverse Repo Rates
As announced in the
First Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2017-18 Resolution of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
, it has been decided to keep the Repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) unchanged at
6.25 per cent
.
However, consequent upon the narrowing of the LAF corridor, the Reverse Repo rate under the LAF now stands adjusted at
6.0 per cent
.
This change will come into force with immediate effect. All other terms and conditions of the current LAF Scheme will remain unchanged.
Yours sincerely
(Radha Shyam Ratho)
Chief General Manager
