2. We have been receiving representations from exporters and their Associations that the banks are not extending the benefits under the Gold Card Scheme as per extant instructions. It is, therefore, reiterated that the instructions relating to the Gold Card Scheme for Exporters as contained in above-mentioned Master Circular shall be strictly implemented and the branch level functionaries suitably sensitised in this regard.

Yours faithfully,
