Dear Sir / Madam
Annual Closing of Government Accounts – Transactions of Central / State Governments – Special Measures for the Current Financial Year (2017-18)
The Government of India has desired that all government transactions with banks for Financial Year 2017-18 must be accounted for within the same financial year and has requested that, as in previous years, certain special arrangements be made for this purpose. Accordingly, all agency banks should keep the counters of their designated branches conducting government banking open for government transactions up to 8.00 p.m. on March 31, 2018. All electronic transactions, including RTGS and NEFT, will continue till midnight on March 31, 2018. Banks may give adequate publicity to the special arrangements made.
Yours faithfully
