Illustration: Substitution of securities in term repos under the liquidity adjustment facility
April 18, 2017
For a successful bid of Rs.200 crore in 14 day Term Repo auction on April 18, 2017, a participant provides a Central Govt. security 8.40% GS 2024 worth Rs. 208 crore market value (including 4% margin for Central Government security).
The dirty price of the security is calculated based on the latest file published by FIMMDA i.e. of April 17, 2017. Assume the price to be Rs.110.
Therefore, the face value of security 8.40% GS 2024 that is debited from Repo Constituent (RC) account (after rounding-up) would be Rs.189.091 crore (208 x 100 /110).
April 20, 2017
The participant chooses to
substitute Rs.100 crore face value
of the security 8.40% GS 2024 with a new security 8.83% GS 2023 on April 20, 2017.
The dirty price of 8.83% GS 2023 would be based on the latest available FIMMDA price in the system i.e. the file published on April 19, 2017. Assume the price to be 115.
The amount of security 8.83% GS 2023 which has to be provided by the market participant in his Repo Constituent in order to substitute the security 8.40% GS 2024 would be calculated as follows:
Required face value of new security to be substituted =
(Market Value of the security intended to be withdrawn, i.e. 8.40 % GS 2024, based on April 17, 2017 price) x 100 / (latest market price of the security offered as substitution, i.e. 8.83% GS 2023, based on April 19, 2017 price = 110 * 100/115 = 95.652
Therefore, in order to substitute Rs.100 crore face value of security 8.40% GS 2024, the participant has to provide Rs. 95.652 crore face value of new security 8.83% GS 2023.
State Government security
If a State government security is offered for substitution, then it would attract 6% margin as hitherto.
