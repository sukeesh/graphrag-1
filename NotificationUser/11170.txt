Dear Sir / Madam
Agency Commission for GST receipt transactions
Please refer to
Para 15
of our Master Circular on Conduct of Government Business by Agency Banks - Payment of Agency Commission dated July 01, 2017 related to claiming of agency commission.
2. After implementation of GST framework, it was decided to modify paragraph 15 of the captioned Master Circular. The modified paragraph 15 will read as follows:
“Agency banks are required to submit their claims for agency commission in the prescribed format to CAS Nagpur in respect of Central government transactions and the respective Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India for State government transactions. However, agency commission claims with respect to GST receipt transactions will be settled at Mumbai Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India only and accordingly all agency banks, authorized to collect GST, are advised to submit their agency commission claims pertaining to GST receipt transactions at Mumbai Regional Office only. The revised formats for claiming agency commission for all agency banks and separate and distinctive set of certificates to be signed by the branch officials and Chartered Accountants are given in
Annex-2
. These certificates would be in addition to the usual Certificate from ED / CGM (in charge of government business) to the effect that there are no pension arrears to be credited / delays in crediting regular pension / arrears thereof.”
3. All other instructions of the said Master Circular remain unchanged.
Yours faithfully
