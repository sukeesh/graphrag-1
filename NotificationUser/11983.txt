Since the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2020 has not been notified for the State Co-operative Banks and Central Co-operative Banks as yet, they are required to furnish three copies of accounts and balance sheet together with auditorâ€™s report as returns to the Reserve Bank and the National Bank (NABARD), in terms of Section 31 read with Section 56 (t) of BR Act, within six months from the end of the period to which they refer, i.e., by September 30, 2020 for the financial year 2019-20. However, taking into account the difficulties being faced by the State Co-operative Banks and Central Co-operative Banks due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Reserve Bank hereby extends the period for furnishing of the returns under Section 31 of the Act for the financial year ended on March 31, 2020 by a further period of three months in terms of the first proviso to the above section. Accordingly, all State Co-operative Banks and Central Co-operative Banks shall ensure submission of the aforesaid returns to the Reserve Bank and NABARD on or before December 31, 2020.
