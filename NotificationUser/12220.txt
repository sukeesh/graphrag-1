(v) Small Business Customers:
This category consists of deposits and other extensions of funds made by non-financial small business customers, as defined in para 5.9.3 (i) of
RBI Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations dated July 1, 2013
, that are managed as retail exposures and are generally considered as having similar liquidity risk characteristics to retail accounts provided total aggregated funding from any such Small Business Customer is upto Rs.5 crore (on a consolidated basis where applicable).
“Aggregated funding” means the gross amount (i.e. not netting any form of credit extended to the legal entity) of all forms of funding (e.g. deposits or debt securities or similar derivative exposure for which the counterparty is known to be a small business customer). Notwithstanding the definition of small business customer as defined in para 5.9.3 (i) of
RBI Master Circular on Basel III Capital Regulations dated July 1, 2013
, a bank may include a deposit in this category provided that the total aggregate funding raised from the customer is upto Rs.5 crore (on an aggregate basis where applicable) and the deposit is managed as a retail deposit. This means that the bank treats such deposits in its internal risk management systems consistently over time and in the same manner as other retail deposits, and that the deposits are not individually managed in a way comparable to larger corporate deposits.

This category consists of deposits and other extensions of funds made by non-financial small business customers, as defined in para 5.9.3 (i) of
