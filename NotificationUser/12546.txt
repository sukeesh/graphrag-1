Madam/Dear Sir,
Display at ATM sites – procedure for lodging of ATM complaints and uniform template for filing complaints
Kindly refer to our letters
DPSS No. 1316/02.10.02/2009-10 dated December 18, 2009
,
DPSS/CO/PD/2018/02.10.02/2009-10 dated March 19, 2010
, on the above subject. We had vide these letters advised banks to display the procedure and contact information, and also make available at all ATM sites, the uniform template circulated by Indian Banks Association (IBA) for lodging of complaints relating to ATM transactions.
2. To assess the compliance to these instructions we had undertaken random visits to number of ATM sites of various banks across the country. It is observed that at a vast majority of the ATM sites the instructions contained in the circulars referred to above have not been adhered to despite a compliance furnished by the banks.
3. You will appreciate that the above system was introduced keeping in view the interest of bank customers. In view of the above observations, we request you to kindly bestow your personal attention to the matter and ensure that the instructions above are adhered to in letter and spirit.
Yours faithfully,
(G. Padmanabhan)
