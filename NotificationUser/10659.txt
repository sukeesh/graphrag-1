Application forms from investors will be received at branches during normal banking hours from October 24, 2016 to November 2, 2016. Receiving Offices need to ensure that the application is complete in all respects as incomplete applications are liable to be rejected. Relevant additional details may be obtained from the applicants, where necessary. The Receiving Offices may make arrangements to enable the investors to apply online, in the interest of better customer service.

Multiple joint holders and nominees (of first holder) are permitted. Necessary details may be obtained from the applicants as per practice.
3. Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements

Identification documents such as passport, the Permanent Account Number (PAN) Card, the Voter's Identity Card, Aadhaar card shall be required. In case of minors only, the bank account number may also be considered as valid for KYC verification. KYC will be done by the issuing banks/SHCIL offices/Post Offices/agents.
4. Interest on application money
Applicants will be paid interest at prevailing savings bank rate from the date of realization of payment to the settlement date, i.e. the period for which they are out of funds.

5. Cancellation
Cancellation of application is permitted till the closure of the issue, i.e., November 2, 2016. Part cancellation of submitted request for purchase of gold bonds is not permitted. No interest on application money needs to be paid if the application is cancelled.
6. Lien marking
As the bonds are government securities, lien marking, etc. will be as per the extant legal provisions of Government Securities Act, 2006 and rules framed there under.
7. Agency arrangement
Receiving Offices may engage NBFCs, NSC agents, LIC agents and others to collect application forms on their behalf. Banks may enter into arrangements or tie-ups with such entities.

8. Processing through RBI’s e-Kuber system
Sovereign Gold Bonds will be available for subscription at the branches of scheduled commercial banks and designated post offices through RBI’s e- Kuber system. The e-Kuber system can be accessed either through Infinet or Internet. The Receiving Offices need to enter the data or carry out bulk upload for the subscriptions received by them. They may ensure accuracy of entry of data to prevent occurrence of any inadvertent errors. An immediate confirmation will be provided to them for receipt of application. In addition, a confirmation scroll will be provided for file uploads to enable the Receiving Offices to update their database. On the date of allotment, i.e., November 17, 2016, Certificates of Holding will be generated for all the subscriptions in the name of the sole/principal holder. The Receiving Offices can download the same and take printouts. The Certificates of Holding will also be sent through e-mail to the investors who have provided their email address.
