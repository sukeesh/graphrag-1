Madam / Dear Sir,
Gold Loan – Bullet Repayment
Please refer to
circular  RPCD.CO.RF.BC.No.60/07.37.02/2009-10 dated March 5, 2010
wherein StCBs/CCBs  were permitted to grant gold loans up to Rs. 1.00 lakh with bullet repayment  option.
2. On a review, it has been decided to increase  the quantum of loan that could be granted under the scheme, from Rs. 1.00 lakh  to Rs. 2.00 lakh subject to the following conditions:
The  period of the loan shall not exceed 12 months from the date of sanction.
Interest will be charged to the  account at monthly rests but will become due for payment along with principal  only at the end of 12 months from the date of sanction.
StCBs/CCBs should maintain a Loan to  Value (LTV) ratio of 75% on the outstanding amount of loan including the  interest on an ongoing basis, failing which the loan will be treated as a Non  Performing Asset (NPA).
The valuation of gold would be as per instructions  contained in para 3 of the
circular  RPCD.RRB.RCB.BC.No.08/03.05.33/2014-15 dated July 1, 2014
