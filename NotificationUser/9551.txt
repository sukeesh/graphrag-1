Dear Sir/Madam,
Inflation Indexed National Savings Securities-
Cumulative, 2013 - Early repayment/redemption
Please refer to our
circular DGBA.CDD.No.2589/13.01.999/2014-2015  dated December 11, 2014
regarding early repayment/ redemption of Inflation Indexed National Savings Securities-Cumulative  (IINSS-C), 2013. In terms of Para 15(ii) of the circular, an investor can seek  early repayment/premature redemption,
(i) after one year of holding if he/she is a  senior citizen (over 65 years of age)
(ii) after 3 years of holding in all other  cases,
subject to deduction of penalty at the rate of 50% of  the last coupon payable. The early redemption is allowed only on coupon date.
2. In this regard, keeping in  view the problems being faced by the investors and the Agency banks, it has  been decided that repayment/early redemption of IINSS-C may be kept open till  the next coupon date and the premature repayment/early redemption requests can be  entertained by the Agency banks on any day after the coupon date, subject to  the penalty of 50% of last coupon. However, no interest would be paid for the  period between the coupon date and the date of the repayment.
Yours  faithfully,
(R. K. Singh)
Deputy General  Manager
