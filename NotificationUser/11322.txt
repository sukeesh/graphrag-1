A) APPOINTMENT / DELISTING OF BROKERS
1. Procedure for enrollment / registration of brokers
Receiving Offices may follow a simple procedure for enrolment/registration of brokers. The broker seeking enrolment/registration may submit the request for registration on their business letterhead together with business data to the Receiving Offices. The Receiving Office should allot a code number to the broker which should be quoted by the broker on all applications tendered at the Receiving offices for claiming brokerage.
2. Appointment of sub-agents by Receiving Offices
It has come to our notice that some Receiving Offices have engaged the services of other banks as brokers/agents for receiving applications and the latter are using the name of RBI in their publicity material and billboards stating that RBI has appointed them as brokers for Relief/Savings Bond business. We advise that in cases where Receiving Offices engage the services of other banks/institutions as a broker or agent, the Receiving Office which have appointed them are solely responsible for their activities as an agents/brokers. RBI's name should not be used by such agents/brokers.
3. Delisting of brokers
The names of the dormant brokers, who have been dormant for say 2 years, may be delisted after giving a due notice if, no fresh business is forthcoming from these brokers.

Brokerage at the rate of ₹ 0.50 (Fifty paise only) per ₹ 100/- will be paid to brokers registered/enrolled with the Receiving Offices on applications tendered for investment in the bonds in the form of Bond Ledger Account (BLA) at Receiving Offices on behalf of their clients and bearing their stamp.
No brokerage is payable in case the broker is one of the investors/applicants.
2. No TDS on payment of brokerage
No tax is required to be deducted at source by the Receiving Office while making payment of brokerage in respect of the Relief/Savings Bonds business canvassed by brokers in terms of Section 194 (H) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
3. Brokerage claims
Receiving Offices are to settle the brokerage claims expeditiously, and in any case, not later than 30 days from the date of subscription.
Receiving Offices are advised to first settle the brokerage claims and thereafter seek reimbursement from RBI.
As a measure towards improvement in customer service, Receiving Offices may arrange to pay the brokerage to the agents, on a monthly basis by credit to their accounts through ECS after obtaining requisite mandate from them.
Reimbursement of brokerage claims in respect of Relief/Savings Bonds has been centralized at CAS Nagpur from July 01, 2002, and it has been decided that 90% of the brokerage due to Receiving Offices, on the basis of funds remitted/reported to CAS as at the close of business of the month, will be paid on the 3rd working day of the succeeding month. The balance 10% is to be settled on submission of Appendix IV statement.
