Dear Sir,
Policy  for sale and purchase of property and acquiring/letting out property on  lease/rental basis by banks at their overseas centres
It has come to our notice that some Indian banks  have committed certain lapses in purchase/sale of real estate as well as in acquiring/letting  out property on lease/rental basis at some places in foreign countries. In order  to avoid such lapses in future it is advised that Boards of Directors of banks should  lay down policies and formulate detailed operational  guidelines to protect the interest of their respective banks.The policy/guidelines  should be compliant with the provisions of Foreign Exchange Management Act,  1999, Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and other relevant Indian laws.The policy  should, interalia, require the agreements for acquiring /letting out premises  on rental/lease basis to incorporate a suitable exit clause.
2. While undertaking transactions in the nature  of sale and purchase of property and acquiring/letting out property on  lease/rental basis at overseas centres banks should also ensure that they  comply with all the applicable laws of the host country /city or locality.
3. Banks  should ensure that all the future transactions relating to purchase/sale of  real estate as well as acquiring /letting out property on lease/rental basis at  overseas centres are undertaken in accordance with the Board approved policy.
Yours faithfully,
(Rajesh Verma)
Chief General  Manager
