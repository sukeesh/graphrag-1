In this connection, attention of authorized persons is drawn to sub-section (5) of Section 10 of the FEMA, 1999 which provides that an authorised person shall require any person desiring to transact in foreign exchange to make such a declaration and to give such information as will reasonably satisfy him that the transaction will not involve and is not designed for the purpose of any contravention or evasion of the provisions of the FEMA or any rule, regulation, notification, direction or order issued there under.
3. With a view to maintaining uniform practices, Authorized Dealers may consider requirements or documents to be obtained by their branches to ensure compliance with provisions of sub-section (5) of section 10 of the Act.
4. Authorised Dealers are also required to keep on record any information / documentation, on the basis of which the transaction was undertaken for verification by the Reserve Bank. In case the applicant refuses to comply with any such requirement or makes unsatisfactory compliance therewith, the Authorised Dealer shall refuse, in writing, to undertake the transaction and shall, if he has reasons to believe that any contravention / evasion is contemplated by the person, report the matter to the Reserve Bank.
5. Reserve Bank of India will not issue any instructions under the FEMA, regarding the procedure to be followed in respect of deduction of tax at source while allowing remittances to the non-residents. It shall be mandatory on the part of Authorised Dealers to comply with the requirement of the tax laws, as applicable.
6. While allowing the facility to resident individuals, Authorised Dealers are required to ensure that “Know Your Customer” guidelines have been implemented in respect of bank accounts. They should also comply with the Anti-Money Laundering Rules in force while allowing the facility.
7. The applicants should have maintained the bank account with the bank for a minimum period of one year prior to the remittances for capital account transactions. If the applicant seeking to make the remittances is a new customer of the bank, Authorised Dealers should carry out due diligence on the opening, operation and maintenance of the account. Further, the Authorised Dealers should obtain bank statement for the previous year from the applicant to satisfy themselves regarding the source of funds. If such a bank statement is not available, copies of the latest Income Tax Assessment Order or Return filed by the applicant may be obtained.
8. The Authorised Dealer should ensure that the payment is received out of funds belonging to the person seeking to make the remittances, by a cheque drawn on the applicant’s bank account or by debit to his account or by Demand Draft / Pay Order.

Master Direction No. 18/2015-16 dated January 01, 2016
(as updated from time to time) on Reporting under FEMA, 1999 for reporting related instructions under the Scheme.
21
13. A number of foreign banks operating in India as well as Indian banks have been soliciting (through advertisements) foreign currency deposits (from residents under LRS) [on behalf of overseas mutual funds] or for placing at their overseas branches. These advertisements may not always contain appropriate disclosures to guide potential depositors giving rise to concerns from the point of view of protecting the interest of the resident individuals. Further, marketing in India of schemes soliciting foreign currency deposits by foreign entities, not having operational presence in India, also raises supervisory concerns. Therefore, all banks, both Indian and foreign, including those not having an operational presence in India, should seek prior approval from RBI for the schemes being marketed by them in India to residents either for soliciting foreign currency deposits for their foreign/overseas branches or for acting as agents for overseas mutual funds or any other foreign financial services company. The applications in this regard may be addressed to the Chief General Manager-in-Charge, Department of Regulations, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, 12th Floor, Fort, Mumbai-400001.
