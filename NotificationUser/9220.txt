Upper age limit for Whole Time Directors on the Boards of Banks
RBI/2014-15/217

To
The Managing  Director & Chief Executive Officers of all Private Sector Banks
Dear Sir / Madam,
Upper  age limit for Whole Time Directors on the Boards of Banks
The matter relating to fixing an upper  age limit for the post of Managing Director & Chief Executive Officers (MD  & CEO) and other Whole Time Directors (WTDs) of banks in private sector in  India has been examined in the light of the provisions of the Companies Act,  2013 [Section 196(3)] which prescribe that ‘no company shall appoint or  continue the employment of any person as Managing Director, Whole Time Director  or Manager who is below the age of 21  years or has attained the age of 70 years’.
2. In view of the above, it has been  decided that the upper age limit for MD & CEO and other WTDs of banks in  the private sector should be 70 years, i.e. beyond which nobody should continue  in the post. Within the overall limit of 70 years, individual bank’s Boards are  free to prescribe a lower retirement age for the WTDs, including the MD &  CEO, as an internal policy.
3.  Please acknowledge receipt.
Yours faithfully,
(Sudha Damodar)
Chief General Manager
