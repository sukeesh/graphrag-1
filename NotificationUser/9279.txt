KYC  – clarification on proof of address
Please refer to our
circular  DBOD.AML.BC. No. 119/14.01.001/2013-14 dated June 9, 2014
on the above  mentioned subject. In this regard we also draw your attention to our letter  dated
DBOD.  AML. No. 3356/14.01.001/2014-15 dated  September 4, 2014
, forwarding copies of a press release dated August 26,  2014, and a poster on KYC simplification measures initiated by us.
2. In this regard, it  has been brought to our notice that despite issuing clear instructions  regarding the requirement of one proof of address whether permanent or current,  some banks are still insisting on submission of a proof of address for the  current address even when a customer produces a proof of permanent address,  which prevents many prospective customers, especially migrant workers, from  opening bank accounts.
3. In view of the  above, banks are advised to ensure that customers are not unnecessarily asked  to submit additional proofs of addresses for current addresses in cases where  proofs of addresses for permanent addresses are already available. Banks are  requested to confirm latest by October 17, 2014, that the above mentioned  instruction has been communicated to all their branches and the same have been  meticulously complied with.
Yours faithfully,
