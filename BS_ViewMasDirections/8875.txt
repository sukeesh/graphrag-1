Dear Sir,
Customer Service in Regional Rural Banks
Customer service has great significance in the  banking industry. The banking system in India today has perhaps the largest  outreach for delivery of financial services and is also serving as an important  conduit for delivery of financial services. While the coverage has been  expanding day by day, the quality and content of dispensation of customer  service has come under tremendous pressure mainly owing to the failure to  handle the soaring demands and expectations of the customers.
2. Reserve Bank, as the regulator of Regional Rural Banks (RRBs),  has been actively engaged from the very beginning in the review, examination  and evaluation of customer service in RRBs by means of various guidelines  issued from time to time to the RRBs. On review it is felt necessary to issue  additional instructions to RRBs on other areas of customer service aligning  with those issued to Scheduled Commercial Banks. These guidelines would be  required to be complied by RRBs in addition to instructions already issued on  Customer Service from time to time.
The additional guidelines are given in
Annex
.
3. Please acknowledge receipt to our Regional  Offices concerned.
Yours faithfully,
(A. Udgata)
Principal  Chief General Manager
