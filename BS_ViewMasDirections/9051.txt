1. Introduction
With a view to monitoring compliance  of maintenance of statutory reserve requirements
viz
. CRR and SLR by the  SCBs, the Reserve Bank of India has prescribed statutory returns
i.e
.  Form A Return (for CRR) under Section 42(2) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  Act, 1934 and Form VIII Return (for SLR) under Section 24 of the Banking  Regulation Act, 1949.
1.1 CRR
In terms of  Section 42(1) of the RBI Act, 1934 the Reserve  Bank, having regard to the needs of securing the monetary stability in the  country, prescribes the CRR for SCBs without any floor or ceiling rate.
1.2 Maintenance of CRR
At  present, effective from the fortnight beginning February 09, 2013, the CRR is  prescribed at 4.00 per cent of a bank's total of DTL adjusted for the  exemptions discussed in paragraphs 1.11 and 1.12.
1.3 Incremental CRR
In terms of  Section 42(1A) of RBI Act, 1934, the SCBs are required to maintain, in addition  to the balances prescribed under Section 42(1) of the Act, an additional  average daily balance, the amount of which shall not be less than the rate  specified by the Reserve Bank in the notification published in the Gazette of  India from time to time. Such additional balance will be calculated with  reference to the excess of the total of DTL of the bank as shown in the Returns  referred to in Section 42(2) of the RBI Act, 1934 over the total of its DTL at  the close of the business on the date specified in the notification.
At present no incremental CRR is  required to be maintained by the banks.
1.4 Computation  of DTL
Liabilities of a  bank may be in the form of demand or time deposits or borrowings or other  miscellaneous items of liabilities. As defined under Section 42 of the RBI Act,  1934, liabilities of a bank may be towards the banking system or towards others  in the form of demand and time deposits or borrowings or other miscellaneous  items of liabilities. The Reserve Bank of India has been authorized in terms of  Section 42(1C) of the RBI Act, 1934, to classify any particular liability and  hence for any doubt regarding classification of a particular liability, banks  are advised to approach the RBI for necessary clarification.
1.5 Demand  Liabilities
Demand Liabilities of a bank  are liabilities which are payable on demand. These include current deposits,  demand liabilities portion of savings bank deposits, margins held against  letters of credit/guarantees, balances in overdue fixed deposits, cash  certificates and cumulative/recurring deposits, outstanding Telegraphic  Transfers (TTs), Mail Transfers (MTs), Demand Drafts (DDs), unclaimed deposits,  credit balances in the Cash Credit account and deposits held as security for  advances which are payable on demand. Money at Call and Short Notice from  outside the banking system should be shown against liability to others.
1.6 Time  Liabilities
Time Liabilities of a bank  are those which are payable otherwise than on demand. These include fixed  deposits, cash certificates, cumulative and recurring deposits, time  liabilities portion of savings bank deposits, staff security deposits, margin  held against letters of credit, if not payable on demand, deposits held as  securities for advances which are not payable on demand and Gold deposits.
1.7 Other Demand and Time Liabilities (ODTL)
ODTL include interest  accrued on deposits, bills payable, unpaid dividends, suspense account balances  representing amounts due to other banks or public, net credit balances in  branch adjustment account, any amounts due to the banking system which are not  in the nature of deposits or borrowing. Such liabilities may arise due to items  like (i) collection of bills on behalf of other banks, (ii) interest due to  other banks and so on. If a bank cannot segregate the liabilities to the  banking system, from the total of ODTL,  the entire ODTL may be shown against item II (c) 'Other Demand and Time  Liabilities' of the return in Form 'A' and average CRR maintained on it by all SCBs.
The balance outstanding in  the blocked account pertaining to segregated outstanding credit entries for  more than 5 years in inter-branch adjustment account, the margin money on bills  purchased / discounted and gold borrowed by banks from abroad, also should be  included in ODTL.
Cash collaterals received under collateralized  derivative transactions should be included in the bank’s DTL/NDTL  for the purpose of reserve requirements as these are in the nature of ‘outside  liabilities’. Accrued interest on  deposits should be calculated on each reporting fortnight (as per the interest  calculation methods applicable to various types of accounts) so that the bank’s  liability in this regard is fairly reflected in the total NDTL of the same  fortnightly return.
1.8 Assets  with the Banking System
Assets with the banking  system include balances with banks in current account, balances with banks and  notified financial institutions in other accounts, funds made available to  banking system by way of loans or deposits repayable at call or short notice of  a fortnight or less and loans other than money at call and short notice made  available to the banking system. Any other amounts due from banking system  which cannot be classified under any of the above items are also to be taken as  assets with the banking system.
1.9 Borrowings  from abroad by banks in India
Loans/borrowings from abroad  by banks in India will be considered as 'liabilities to others' and will be  subject to reserve requirements. Upper Tier II instruments raised and  maintained abroad shall be reckoned as liability for the computation of DTL for  the purpose of reserve requirements.
1.10 Arrangements with Correspondent Banks  for Remittance Facilities
When a bank accepts funds  from a client under its remittance facilities scheme, it becomes a liability  (liability to others) in its books. The liability of the bank accepting funds  will extinguish only when the correspondent bank honours the drafts issued by  the accepting bank to its customers. As such, the balance amount in respect of  the drafts issued by the accepting bank on its correspondent bank under the  remittance facilities scheme and remaining unpaid should be reflected in the  accepting bank's books as liability under the head 'Liability to others in  India' and the same should also be taken into account for computation of DTL  for CRR/SLR purpose.
The amount received by  correspondent banks has to be shown as 'Liability to the Banking System' by  them and not as 'Liability to others' and this liability could be netted off by  the correspondent banks against the inter-bank assets. Likewise sums placed by  banks issuing drafts/interest/dividend warrants are to be treated as 'Assets  with banking system' in their books and can be netted off from their inter-bank  liabilities.
1.11 Liabilities not to be included for DTL/NDTL  computation
The under-noted liabilities  will not form part of liabilities for the purpose of CRR and SLR:
a) Paid  up capital, reserves, any credit balance in the Profit & Loss Account of  the bank, amount of any loan taken from the RBI and the amount of refinance  taken from Exim Bank, NHB, NABARD, SIDBI;
b) Net income tax provision;
c) Amount  received from DICGC towards claims and held by banks pending  adjustments thereof;
d) Amount received from ECGC by invoking the  guarantee;
e) Amount  received from insurance company on ad-hoc settlement of claims pending judgment  of the Court;
f) Amount received from the Court  Receiver;
g) The  liabilities arising on account of utilization of limits under Bankers  Acceptance Facility (BAF);
h) District  Rural Development Agency (DRDA) subsidy of Rs.10,000/- kept in Subsidy Reserve  Fund account in the name of Self Help Groups;
i) Subsidy  released by NABARD under Investment Subsidy Scheme for Construction/Renovation/Expansion  of Rural Godowns;
j)  Net unrealized gain/loss arising from derivatives transaction under trading  portfolio;
k) Income flows received in advance such as  annual fees and other charges which are not refundable.
l) Bill rediscounted by a bank with eligible  financial institutions as approved by RBI and,
(m) Provision  not being a specific liability arising from contracting additional liability and  created from profit and loss account.
(n)  The eligible amount of incremental FCNR (B)  and NRE deposits of maturities of three years and above from the base date of  July 26, 2013, and outstanding as on March 7, 2014, till their  maturities/pre-mature withdrawals.
1.12 Exempted Categories
SCBs are exempted from  maintaining CRR on the following liabilities:
i. Liabilities to  the banking system in India as computed under clause (d) of the
        explanation to Section 42(1) of the RBI Act,  1934;
ii. Credit  balances in ACU (US$) Accounts; and
iii.  Demand and Time Liabilities in respect of their Offshore Banking Units (OBU).
1.13 Loans out of FCNR (B) Deposits and  Inter-Bank Foreign Currency (IBFC) Deposits
Loans out of Foreign  Currency Non–Resident Accounts (Banks), (FCNR [B] Deposits Scheme) and  Inter-Bank Foreign Currency (IBFC) deposits should be included as part of bank  credit while reporting in Form ’A’ Return. For the  purpose of reporting, banks should convert their foreign currency  assets/liabilities (including foreign currency borrowings) in USD, GBP, JPY and  Euro into INR at RBI Reference Rates announced on the Reserve Bank of India  website. As regards conversion of assets/liabilities in other currencies, banks  may use New York Closing Rate pertaining to the day end of the Reporting Friday, for  converting such currencies into USD and then use the RBI Reference Rate for USD  / INR for the same day for conversion into INR.
1.14 Procedure for Computation of CRR
In order to improve cash  management by banks, as a measure of simplification, a lag of one  fortnight in the maintenance of stipulated CRR by banks was introduced with  effect from the fortnight beginning November 06, 1999.
1.15  Maintenance of CRR on Daily Basis
With a view to providing  flexibility to banks in choosing an optimum strategy of holding reserves  depending upon their intra fortnight cash flows, all SCBs are required to  maintain minimum CRR balances up to 95 per cent of the average daily  required reserves for a reporting fortnight on all days of the fortnight  with effect from the fortnight beginning September 21, 2013.
1.16 No Interest Payment on Eligible Cash  Balances maintained by SCBs with RBI  under CRR
In view of the amendment  carried out to RBI Act 1934, omitting sub-section (1B) of Section 42, the  Reserve Bank does not pay any interest on the CRR balances maintained by SCBs with  effect from the fortnight beginning March 31, 2007.
1.17 Fortnightly Return in Form A (CRR)
Under Section 42(2) of the RBI  Act, 1934, all SCBs are required to submit to Reserve Bank a provisional Return  in Form 'A' within 7 days from the expiry of the relevant fortnight which  is used for preparing press communiqué. The final Form 'A' Return is required  to be submitted to RBI within 20 days from expiry of the relevant fortnight.  Based on the recommendation of the Working Group on Money Supply: Analytics and  Methodology of Compilation, all SCBs in India are required to submit from the  fortnight beginning October 9, 1998, Memorandum to Form 'A' Return giving  details about paid-up capital, reserves, time deposits comprising short-term  (of contractual maturity of one year or less) and long-term (of contractual  maturity of more than one year),certificates of deposits, NDTL,  total CRR requirement etc., Annexure A to Form ‘A’ Return showing all foreign  currency liabilities and assets and Annexure B to Form ‘A’ Return giving  detailsabout investment in approved securities, investment in  non-approved securities, memo items such as subscription to shares  /debentures / bonds in primary market and subscriptions through private  placement.
The  present practice of calculation of the proportion of demand liabilities and  time liabilities by SCBs in respect of their savings bank deposits on the basis  of the position as at the close of business on 30th September and 31st  March every year (cf. RBI circular DBOD.No.BC.142/09.16.001/97-98 dated  November 19, 1997) shall continue in the new system of interest application on  savings bank deposits on a daily product basis. The average of the minimum  balances maintained in each of the month during the half year period shall be  treated by the bank as the amount representing the "time liability” portion  of the savings bank deposits. When such an amount is deducted from the average  of the actual balances maintained during the half year period, the difference  would represent the "demand liability” portion. The proportions of demand  and time liabilities so obtained for each half year shall be applied for  arriving at demand and time liabilities components of savings bank deposits for  all reporting fortnights during the next half year.
1.18 Penalties
From  the fortnight beginning June 24, 2006, penal interest is charged as under in cases  of default in maintenance of CRR by SCBs:
(i) In case of default in maintenance of CRR  requirement on a daily basis which is presently 95 per cent of the total CRR  requirement, penal interest will be recovered for that day at the rate of three  per cent per annum above the Bank Rate on the amount by which the amount  actually maintained falls short of the prescribed minimum on that day and if  the shortfall continues on the next succeeding day/s, penal interest will be  recovered at the rate of five per cent per annum above the Bank Rate.
(ii) In cases of default in maintenance of CRR on average basis during a  fortnight, penal interest will be recovered as envisaged in sub-section (3) of Section  42 of Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.
SCBs  are required to furnish the particulars such as date, amount, percentage,  reason for default in maintenance of requisite CRR and also action taken to  avoid recurrence of such default.
2. Maintenance of Statutory Liquidity  Ratio (SLR)
Consequent  upon amendment to the Section 24 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 through the  Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act, 2007 replacing the Regulation (Amendment)  Ordinance, 2007, effective January 23, 2007, the Reserve Bank can prescribe the  SLR for SCBs in specified assets. The value of such assets of a SCB shall not  be less than such percentage not exceeding 40 per cent of its total DTL in  India as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight as the Reserve  Bank may, by notification in the Official Gazette, specify from time to time.
SCBs  can participate in the Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) Scheme introduced by  Reserve Bank with effect from May 09, 2011. Under this facility, the eligible  entities may borrow up to two per cent of their respective NDTL outstanding at  the end of the second preceding fortnight from April 17, 2012. Additionally,  the eligible entities may also continue to access overnight funds under this  facility against their excess SLR holdings. In the event, the banks’ SLR  holding falls below the statutory requirement up to two per cent of their NDTL,  banks will not have the obligation to seek a specific waiver for default in SLR  compliance arising out of use of this facility in terms of notification issued  under sub section (2A) of section 24 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
The  borrowing limit below the stipulated SLR under MSF was raised from 2 per cent  to 2.5 per cent of their NDTL for a temporary period. The higher MSF limit of  0.5 per cent of NDTL was available only for the RBI’s Special Repo Window  announced on July 17, 2013, to meet the liquidity requirement of Mutual Funds  and remained valid upto October 29, 2013.
Reserve Bank has specified  vide notification
DBOD.No.Ret.BC.118/12.02.001/2013-14 dated June 3, 2014
that  w.e.f. the fortnight beginning June 14, 2014, every SCB shall continue to  maintain in India assets as detailed below, the value of which shall not, at  the close of business on any day, be less than 22.5 per cent of the total NDTL  as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight valued in accordance  with the method of valuation specified by the Reserve Bank of India from time  to time:
(a) Cash or (b) Gold valued at a price not  exceeding the current market price, or (c) Investment in the following instruments which will be referred to as  "Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) securities":
(i) Dated  securities issued up to May 06, 2011as listed in the Annex  to Notification DBOD.No.Ret.91/12.02.001/2010-11 dated May 09, 2011;
(ii) Treasury  Bills of the Government of India;
(iii) Dated  securities of the Government of India issued from time to time under the market  borrowing programme and the Market Stabilization Scheme;
(iv) State  Development Loans (SDLs) of the State Governments issued from time to time  under the market borrowing programme; and
(v) Any  other instrument as may be notified by the Reserve Bank of India.
Provided that the securities (including margin) referred to above, if  acquired under the Reserve Bank- Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), shall not  be treated as an eligible asset for this purpose.
Explanation:
1. For the above purpose, "market borrowing programme" shall  mean the domestic rupee loans raised by the Government of India and the State  Governments from the public and managed by the Reserve Bank of India through  issue of marketable securities, governed by the Government Securities Act, 2006  and the Regulations framed there under, through an auction or any other method,  as specified in the Notification issued in this regard.
2. Encumbered  SLR securities shall not  be included for the purpose of computing the percentage specified above.
Provided that for the purpose of computing the percentage of  assets referred to hereinabove, the following shall be included, viz:
(i) securities lodged with another  institution for an advance or any other credit arrangement to the extent  to which such securities have not been drawn against or availed of; and,
(ii) securities offered as collateral to the Reserve Bank of India  for availing liquidity assistance from Marginal Standing Facility (MSF) up to two  percent of the total NDTL in India carved out of the required SLR portfolio of  the bank concerned.
3. In computing the amount for the above purpose, the following shall  be deemed to be cash maintained in India:
(i) The deposit required under sub-section (2) of  Section 11 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 to be made with the Reserve Bank  by a banking company incorporated outside India;
(ii) Any balance maintained by a scheduled bank  with the Reserve Bank in excess of the balance required to be maintained by it  under Section 42 of the Reserve Bank of India Act,1934 (2 of 1934);
(iii) Net balance in current accounts with other SCBs  in India.
Note:
1. With a view to  disseminating information on the SLR status of a Government security, it  has   been decided that:
(i) the SLR status of  securities issued by the Government of India and the State Governments will be  indicated in the Press Release issued by the Reserve Bank of India at the time  of issuance of the securities; and,
(ii) an updated and  current list of the SLR securities will be posted on the Reserve Bank's website  (
www.rbi.org.in
) under the link  "Database on Indian Economy”
2. The cash management bill will be  treated as Government of India Treasury Bill and accordingly shall be treated  as SLR securities.
2.1 Procedure for Computation of SLR
The procedure to compute  total NDTL for the purpose of SLR under Section 24 (2A) of Banking Regulation Act,  1949 is broadly similar to the procedure followed for CRR. The liabilities  mentioned under Section 1.11 will not form part of liabilities for the purpose  of SLR also. SCBs are required to include inter-bank term deposits / term  borrowing liabilities of all maturities in 'Liabilities to the Banking System'.  Similarly, banks should include their inter-bank assets of term deposits and  term lending of all maturities in 'Assets with the Banking System' for  computation of NDTL for SLR purpose.
2.2 Classification and Valuation of Approved  Securities for SLR
As regards classification  and valuation of approved securities, banks may be guided by the instructions  contained in our Master Circular (as updated from time to time) on Prudential  Norms for Classification, Valuation and Operation of Investment Portfolio by  banks.
2.3 Penalties
If a banking company fails  to maintain the required amount of SLR, it shall be liable to pay to RBI in  respect of that default, the penal interest for that day at the rate of three per  cent per annum above the Bank Rate on the shortfall and if the default  continues on the next succeeding working day, the penal interest may be  increased to a rate of five per cent per annum above the Bank Rate for the  concerned days of default on the shortfall.
2.4 Return in Form VIII (SLR)
i) Banks should submit to  the Reserve Bank before 20th day of every month, a Return in Form VIII  showing the amounts of SLR held on alternate Fridays during immediate preceding  month with particulars of their DTL in India held on such Fridays or if any  such Friday is a public holiday under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881,  at the close of business on preceding working day.
ii) Banks should also submit  a statement as Annexure to Form VIII Return giving daily position of (a)assets  held for the purpose of compliance with SLR, (b)the excess cash balances  maintained by them with RBI in the prescribed format, and (c) the mode of  valuation of securities.
2.5 Correctness of computation of DTL to be certified by Statutory  Auditors
The Statutory Auditors should verify and certify  that all items of outside liabilities, as per the bank’s books had been duly  compiled by the bank and correctly reflected under DTL/NDTL in the  fortnightly/monthly statutory returns submitted to Reserve Bank for the  financial year.
