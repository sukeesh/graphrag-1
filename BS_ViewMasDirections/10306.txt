Annex
Capital Charge for Foreign Exchange (FE) Position:
Market Risk: As prescribed in the existing capital adequacy guidelines, the capital charge for market risk in foreign exchange may be worked out by the standardised approach and the internal risk management framework based Value at Risk (VaR) model. The capital charge for market risk would be higher of the two requirements.
Under standardised approach, PDâ€™s net open positions in each currency should be calculated and the same shall be risk weighted as 100 per cent. These open positions shall be subject to a flat market risk charge of 15 per cent.
Credit Risk: Since currency futures contracts would be subject to CCP clearing of the authorised stock exchanges, capital charge for credit risk would be calculated as per methodology prescribed for calculation of capital charge for exposure towards CCP issued vide
circular IDMD.PCD.11/14.03.05/2013-14 dated March 27, 2014
. The Credit Conversion Factor (CCF) to be used for exchange rate contracts would be as under:
CCF for Market-Related Off-Balance Sheet Items
Residual Maturity
CCF (%)
Exchange Rate Contracts
One year or less
2.00
Over one year to five years
10.00
Over five years
15.00
