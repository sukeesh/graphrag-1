2. In this regard, it has come to the notice  of Reserve Bank that some banks are yet to complete the allotment of UCIC and  accordingly have sought some more time. In view the requests received, it has  been decided to extend the time for completing the process of allotting UCIC to  existing customers up to December 31, 2014.
3. RRBs  and StCBs/CCBs are, therefore, advised to expedite the procedure and complete  the work of allotting UCIC to all the existing individual customers, within the  stipulated timeframe. They may chalk out a plan for completing the work and  furnish the monthly progress report to their Board. Considering the fact that a  period of two years has been allotted for completion of the task, no further  extension in this regard would be considered.
4. It is mandatory for RRBs  and StCBs/CCBs to comply with these instructions and non-compliance would  invite penal consequences.
Yours faithfully,
(A. Udgata)
