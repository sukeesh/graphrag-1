DNBR.CC.PD.No.027/03.10.01/2014-15
April 08, 2015
To
All NBFC-MFIs
Dear Sirs,
Non-Banking Financial Company-Micro Finance Institutions (NBFC-MFIs) – Directions – Modifications
The captioned directions contained in the
notification DNBS.PD.No.234/CGM (US)-2011 dated December 2, 2011
and subsequent modifications were issued to NBFC-MFIs in the backdrop of the Andhra Pradesh-MFI crisis. The sector has largely moved forward since then. Accordingly certain modifications as given below are being introduced.
2. In terms of para 3(ii)(a) of the aforesaid Notification, loan disbursed by an NBFC-MFI to a borrower with a rural household annual income not exceeding Rs. 60,000 or urban and semi-urban household income not exceeding Rs. 1,20,000 would be eligible to be defined as qualifying asset. In order to widen the scope, it has been decided that loan disbursed by an NBFC-MFI to a borrower with a rural household annual income not exceeding Rs. 1,00,000 or urban and semi-urban household income not exceeding Rs. 1,60,000 would be eligible to be defined as a qualifying asset.
3. In terms of para 3(ii)(c) of the aforesaid Notification, NBFCs-MFI while disbursing loans were required to ensure that the total indebtedness of the borrower does not exceed Rs.50,000. In partial modification of the above, the limit of total indebtedness of the borrower has been increased to Rs.1,00,000. Education and medical expenses will be excluded while arriving at the total indebtedness of a borrower.
4. In terms of para 3(ii)(b) of the aforesaid Notification, loan amount should not exceed Rs. 35,000 in the first cycle and Rs. 50,000 in subsequent cycles. In light of the revision to the limit on total indebtedness, it has been decided to revise the limit on disbursal of loans. Henceforth, the loan amount should not exceed Rs. 60,000 in the first cycle and Rs. 1,00,000 in subsequent cycles.
5. In terms of para 3(ii)(f) of the aforesaid Notification, aggregate amount of loans given for income generation should constitute at least 70 per cent of the total loans of the NBFC-MFI so that the remaining 30 per cent can be for other purposes such as housing repairs, education, medical and other emergencies. The limits so prescribed are henceforth revised to 50:50 i.e. loans given for income generation should constitute at least 50 per cent of the total loans of the NBFC-MFI and the remaining 50 per cent can be for other purposes as stated above.
6. Notwithstanding the above, all NBFC-MFIs are expected to be prudent and responsible in their lending activity besides educating their borrowers on the dangers of wasteful conspicuous consumption.
7. Notifications of date amending the Non-Banking Financial Company-Micro Finance Institutions’ (NBFC-MFIs) - Directions, 2011, Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial (Non-Deposit Accepting or Holding) Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2015 and Non-Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial (Non-Deposit Accepting or Holding) Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2015 are
