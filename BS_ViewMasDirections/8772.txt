Dear  Sir,
Annual Credit Plans –  Potential Linked Plan (PLPs) prepared by NABARD
Please refer to the
circular  RPCD.CO.LBS. (SAA) BC.No.93/08.01.00/2004-05 dated April 11, 2005
advising  all scheduled commercial banks including Regional Rural Banks that a pre-PLP  meeting may be convened by Lead District Manager during August /September to be  attended by the banks, Government  agencies etc.
2. In this connection, NABARD has requested to  consider advising LDMs to hold the pre-PLP meeting in the month of June every  year as PLPs are now finalized by August every year.  The matter has been examined and it has been decided that henceforth the  pre-PLP meeting may be convened by LDMs during June every year. Accordingly, Lead Banks may ensure that  pre-PLP meetings may be convened by LDMs during June every year.
Yours faithfully,
(A. Udgata)
Principal Chief General  Manager
