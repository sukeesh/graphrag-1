6.1 In respect of a contravention committed by any person within a period of three years from the date on which a similar contravention committed by him was compounded under the Compounding Rules, such contraventions would not be compounded and relevant provisions of the FEMA, 1999 shall apply. Any second or subsequent contravention committed after the expiry of a period of three years from the date on which the contravention was previously compounded shall be deemed to be a first contravention.
6.2 Contraventions relating to any transaction where proper approvals or permission from the Government or any statutory authority concerned, as the case may be, have not been obtained, such contraventions would not be compounded unless the required approvals are obtained from the concerned authorities.
6.3 Cases of contravention, such as, those
having serious contravention suspected of money laundering, terror financing or affecting sovereignty and integrity of the nation
or where the contravener fails to pay the sum for which contravention was compounded within the specified period in terms of the compounding order, shall be referred to the Directorate of Enforcement for further investigation and necessary action under FEMA, 1999 or to the authority instituted for implementation of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002, or to any other agencies, for necessary action as deemed fit.
6.4 In case where adjudication has been done by the Directorate of Enforcement and an appeal has been filed under section 17 or section 19 of FEMA, 1999, no contravention can be compounded in terms of Rule 11 of Foreign Exchange (Compounding Proceedings) Rules, 2000. The applicant shall confirm in the undertaking required to be furnished as per
Annex III
along with the compounding application that they have not filed any appeal under section 17 or section 19 of FEMA, 1999.
6.5 In this connection, it is clarified that whenever a contravention is identified by the Reserve Bank or brought to its notice by the entity involved in contravention, the Bank shall examine
(i) whether it is material and, hence is required to be compounded for which the necessary compounding procedure has to be followed or
(ii) whether the issues involved are sensitive / serious in nature and, therefore, need to be referred to the Directorate of Enforcement (DOE).
6.6 In terms of the proviso to rule 8 (2) of Foreign Exchange (Compounding Proceedings) Rules, 2000 inserted vide GOI notification dated February 20, 2017, if the Enforcement Directorate is of the view that the compounding proceeding relates to a serious contravention suspected of money laundering, terror financing or affecting sovereignty and integrity of the nation, the Compounding Authority shall not proceed with the matter and shall remit the case to the appropriate Adjudicating Authority for adjudicating contravention under section 13.
Further, the cases attracting the provisions under section 3(a) or those attracting special provisions under section 37(A) of the FEMA, 1999 - relating to assets held outside India in contravention of section 4, shall also not be eligible for compounding by the Reserve Bank.
7. Scope and procedure for compounding
7.1 On receipt of the application for compounding, the Reserve Bank shall examine the application based on the documents and submissions made in the application and assess whether contravention is quantifiable and, if so, the amount of contravention.
7.2 The Compounding Authority may call for any information, record or any other documents relevant to the compounding proceedings. In case the contravener fails to submit the additional information/documents called for within the specified period, the application for compounding will be liable
to be returned
.
7.3 The following factors, which are only indicative, may be taken into consideration for the purpose of passing compounding order and adjudging the quantum of sum on payment of which contravention shall be compounded:
a) the amount of gain of unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the contravention;
b) the amount of loss caused to any authority/ agency/ exchequer as a result of the contravention;
c) economic benefits accruing to the contravener from delayed compliance or compliance avoided;
d) the repetitive nature of the contravention, the track record and/or history of non-compliance of the contravener;
e) contravener’s conduct in undertaking the transaction and in disclosure of full facts in the application and submissions made during the personal hearing; and any other factor as considered relevant and appropriate.
7.4

As per provisions of section 13 of FEMA the amount imposed can be up to three times the amount involved in the contravention. However, the amount imposed is calculated based on guidance note given below. It may, however, be noted that the guidance note is meant only for the purpose of broadly indicating the basis on which the amount to be imposed is derived by the compounding authorities in Reserve Bank of India.

*The contraventions of FEMA 20 existing and continuing as on November 07, 2017 (i.e. the starting date of contraventions prior to November 07, 2017) will be compounded as per 1(A) above.
II. The above amounts are presently subject to the following provisos, viz.
the amount imposed should not exceed 300% of the amount of contravention
In case the amount of contravention is less than Rs. One lakh, the total amount imposed should not be more than amount of simple interest @5% p.a. calculated on the amount of contravention and for the period of the contravention in case of reporting contraventions and @10% p.a. in respect of all other contraventions.
In case of paragraph 8 of Schedule I to FEMA 20/2000 RB contraventions, the amount imposed will be further graded as under:
If the shares are allotted after 180 days without the prior approval of Reserve Bank, 1.25 times the amount calculated as per table above (subject to provisos at (i) & (ii) above).
If the shares are not allotted and the amount is refunded after 180 days with the Bank’s permission: 1.50 times the amount calculated as per table above (subject to provisos at (i) & (ii) above).
If the shares are not allotted and the amount is refunded after 180 days without the Bank’s permission: 1.75 times the amount calculated as per table above (subject to provisos at (i) & (ii) above).
In cases where it is established that the contravenor has made undue gains, the amount thereof may be neutralized to a reasonable extent by adding the same to the compounding amount calculated as per chart.
If a party who has been compounded earlier applies for compounding again for similar contravention, the amount calculated as above may be enhanced by 50%.
III. For calculating amount in respect of reporting contraventions under para I.1 above, the period of contravention may be considered proportionately {(approx. rounded off to next higher month ÷ 12) X amount for 1 year}. The total no. of days does not exclude Sundays/holidays.
8. Issue of the Compounding Order
8.1 The Compounding Authority shall pass an order of compounding after affording an opportunity of being heard to all the concerned as expeditiously as possible as and not later than 180 days from the date of application on the basis of the averments made in the application as well as other documents and submissions made in this context by the contravener during the personal hearings.
8.2 The time limit for this purpose would be reckoned from the date of receipt of the completed application for compounding by the Reserve Bank.
8.3 If the applicant opts for appearing for the personal hearing, the Reserve Bank would encourage the applicant to appear directly for it rather than being represented / accompanied by legal experts / consultants, as compounding is only for admitted contraventions. Appearing for or opting out of personal hearing does not have any bearing whatsoever on the amount imposed in the compounding order. If the authorized representative of the applicant is unavailable for the personal hearing, the Compounding Authority may pass the order based on available information/ documents.
8.4 The Compounding Order shall specify the provisions of the FEMA, 1999 or any rule, regulation, notification, direction or order issued in exercise of the powers under FEMA, 1999 in respect of which contravention has taken place along with details of the contravention.
8.5 One copy of the compounding order issued under sub rule (2) of Rule 8 of Foreign Exchange (Compounding Proceedings) Rules, 2000 shall be supplied to the applicant (the contravener) and also to the Adjudicating Authority, where the compounding of any contravention is made after making of a complaint under sub-section (3) of section 16 of the FEMA, as the case may be.

8.6 In terms of
AP (DIR Series) Circular No. 06 dated November 17, 2020

9. Payment of the amount for which contravention is compounded
9.1 The sum for which the contravention is compounded as specified in the order of compounding shall be paid by way of demand draft in favour of the “Reserve Bank of India” within 15 days from the date of the order of compounding of such contravention. The manner in which the demand draft has to be drawn and deposited shall be indicated in the compounding order.
9.2 The provisions of the Rules do not confer any right to the contravener, after a compounding order is passed, to seek to withdraw the order or to hold that the compounding order is void or request review of the order passed by the Compounding Authority.
9.3 In case of failure to pay the sum compounded within the time specified in the compounding order and the Foreign Exchange (Compounding Proceedings) Rules, 2000, it shall be deemed that the contravener had never made an application for compounding of any contravention under these Rules.
9.4 In respect of the contraventions of the FEMA, 1999 which are not compounded by the Compounding Authority, other relevant provisions of FEMA, 1999 dealing with contraventions shall apply accordingly.
9.5 On realization of the sum for which contravention is compounded a certificate in this regard shall be issued by the Reserve Bank subject to the specified conditions, if any, in the order.
10. Directions to Authorised Dealers
10.1 In terms of Section 11 (2) of FEMA, 1999, the Reserve Bank may, for the purpose of ensuring the compliance with the provisions of the Act or of any rule, regulation, notification, direction or order made thereunder, direct any authorized person to furnish such information, in such manner, as it deems fit. Accordingly, RBI has entrusted to the Authorised Dealers (ADs) the responsibility of complying with the prescribed rules/ regulations for the foreign exchange transactions and reporting the same as per the directions issued from time to time. Authorised Dealers have, therefore, advised to take necessary steps to ensure that checks and balances are incorporated in systems relating to dealing with and reporting of foreign exchange transactions so that contraventions of provisions of FEMA, 1999 attributable to the Authorised Dealers do not occur.
10.2 In this connection, it is reiterated that in terms of Section 11(3) of FEMA, 1999, the Reserve Bank may impose on the authorized person a penalty for contravening any direction given by the Reserve Bank under this Act or failing to file any return as directed by the Reserve Bank.
11. Reporting requirements.
