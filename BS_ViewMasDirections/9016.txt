INTRODUCTION
1.1 The minimum maturity period of the  deposit under the FCNR(B) Scheme, which was initially six months, was raised to  one year, effective October, 1999. From July 26, 2005, banks were allowed to  accept FCNR(B) deposits up to a maximum maturity period of five years, against  the earlier maximum limit of three years.
1.2 To begin with, the FCNR(B) Scheme was  applicable to deposits accepted in four currencies, viz., Pound Sterling, US  Dollar, Deutsche Mark and Japanese Yen.  On November 4, 2000 the FCNR(B) Scheme was extended to cover  deposits in Euro while deposits in Deutsche Mark were accepted  only up to December 31, 2001. Maturity  proceeds after this date on deposits in Deutsche Mark were payable only in Euro.  With effect from January 1, 2002, the acceptable currencies for FCNR(B)  deposits were Pound Sterling,   US Dollar,  Japanese Yen and Euro. On July 26, 2005 the Scheme was extended to cover  FCNR(B) deposits denominated in Canadian dollar and Australian dollar, in  addition to the existing four currencies viz., US dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro  and Japanese Yen. Based on the recommendations of the Committee to Review the  Facilities for Individuals under FEMA, 1999, Foreign Exchange Department (FED)  has permitted banks to accept FCNR(B) deposits in any permitted currency with  effect from October 19, 2011. 'Permitted currency' for this purpose would mean  a foreign currency which is freely convertible as defined in terms of  Regulation 2(v) of
FEMA  14/2000-RB dated May 3, 2000
, as amended from time to time.
1.3 Originally,  the interest rates on FCNR(B) deposits were the same as those prescribed for  FCNR(A) deposits. Effective April 16, 1997, banks were free to determine the  interest rates (fixed or  floating with an interest reset period of 6 months) subject to a prescribed  ceiling. The present ceiling rate in respect of FCNR(B) deposits for  the respective currency / corresponding maturity is LIBOR/SWAP rate plus 200/300  basis points, as the case may be, effective from the close of business in India  as on May  4, 2012.
1.4 Earlier, up to January, 2006, LIBOR / SWAP rates as on the  last working day of the previous month formed the base for fixing ceiling rates  for interest on NRE/FCNR(B) deposits that would be offered effective from the  following month. In order to ensure uniformity and transparency in interest  rates on NRE/FCNR(B) deposit, it was decided that FEDAI would quote / display  the LIBOR / SWAP rates which will be used by banks in arriving at the interest  rates on NRI deposits. The first such rates were indicated by FEDAI for the  last working day of February, 2006.
1.5 A  commercial bank which is an Authorised Dealer in foreign exchange should not  pay interest on deposits of money accepted by it or renewed by it under the  Foreign Currency (Non-Resident) Accounts (Banks) Scheme, which came into force  from May 15, 1993, except in accordance with the rates as specified in
Annex
hereto and on the terms and conditions specified in the guidelines given  below.
2
GUIDELINES
2.1
Definition of the  term “Deposit”
The deposits under  the Scheme mean “term deposits” received by the bank for a fixed period and  withdrawable only after the expiry of the said fixed period and includes  Reinvestment Deposits and Cash Certificates or other deposits of similar  nature.
2.2
Other important  features of the Scheme
(i) The Scheme covers deposits in any  permitted currency with effect from October 19, 2011 from non-resident  individuals of Indian nationality or origin (NRIs).
Note:
a) The facility of opening and maintaining FCNR(B) Accounts by Overseas  Corporate Bodies (OCBs) such as overseas companies, firms, societies and other corporate  bodies which are owned directly or indirectly to the extent of at least 60 per  cent by NRIs and overseas trusts in which at least 60 per cent of the  beneficial interest is irrevocably held by such persons has been withdrawn with  effect from September 16, 2003.
b)  An existing FCNR(B) Account held in the name of an OCB may be continued till  original maturity and on maturity the proceeds should be repatriated forthwith.
(ii)   Repatriation of funds in foreign  currencies is permitted.
(iii)  The deposits should be accepted  under the Scheme for the following maturity periods:
One year and above but less  than two years
Two years and above but less  than three years
Three years and above but  less than four years
Four years and above but  less than five years
Five years only
Note:
Recurring Deposits should
not
be accepted under the FCNR(B) Scheme.
(iv) Transfer of funds from existing NRE  accounts to FCNR(B) accounts and vice versa, of the same account holder, is  permissible without the prior approval of Reserve Bank of India.
(v) A bank should obtain prior approval of  its Board of Directors for the interest rates that it will offer on deposits of  various maturities, within the ceiling prescribed by Reserve Bank of India. The  Board of Directors of a bank may authorise the Asset Liability Management  Committee to fix interest rates on deposits subject to reporting to the Board  immediately thereafter.
2.3
Manner of payment of interest
i) The interest on the deposits accepted  under the scheme should be paid on the basis of 360 days to a year.
ii) The interest on FCNR(B) deposits should  be calculated and paid at intervals of 180 days each and thereafter for the  remaining actual number of days. However, the depositor will have the option to  receive the interest on maturity with compounding effect.
2.4
Discretion to pay additional interest not  exceeding one percent on deposits of bank’s staff
As per earlier instructions, in the  case of FCNR(B) deposits of staff members, existing or retired, interest rate  including any additional interest paid to them by virtue of their being staff  members, should not exceed the ceiling stipulated by Reserve Bank of India from  time to time.
On a review, it has  been decided that with effect from July 18, 2012, banks should not allow the benefit  of additional interest rate on any type of deposits of non-residents.  Accordingly, the discretion given to banks to allow the benefit of additional  interest rate of one percent per annum as available to bank's own staff on  deposits under FCNR (B) accounts stands withdrawn.
2.5
Premature withdrawal of deposits
(i) Banks on request from the depositor  should permit premature withdrawal of deposits under the FCNR(B) Scheme. Banks  are free to levy penalty for such premature withdrawal at their discretion.  Banks may also, at their discretion, levy penalty to recover the swap cost in  the case of premature withdrawal of FCNR(B) deposits. Where premature  withdrawal of FCNR(B) deposits takes place before completion of the minimum  stipulated period of one year, in which case no interest is payable, banks may  at their discretion levy penalty to cover the swap cost. However, the  components of penalty should be clearly brought to the notice of the depositors  at the time of acceptance of the deposits. If the depositors are not informed  of the penalty provisions at the time of acceptance of deposits, the exchange  loss arising out of premature withdrawal will have to be borne by the banks.
(ii) Conversion of FCNR(B) deposits into NRE  deposits or vice-versa before maturity should be subject to the penal provision  relating to premature withdrawal.
2.6
Payment  of interest on overdue FCNR(B) deposits
Banks  may, at their discretion, renew an overdue deposit or a portion thereof  provided the overdue period from the date of maturity till the date of renewal  (both days inclusive) does not exceed 14 days. The rate of interest payable on  the amount of the deposit so renewed should be the appropriate rate of interest  for the period of renewal as prevailing on the date of maturity or on the date  when the depositor seeks renewal, whichever is lower. In the case of overdue deposits where the  overdue period exceeds 14 days and if the depositor places the entire amount of  overdue deposit or a portion thereof as a fresh FCNR(B) deposit, banks may fix  their own interest rates for the overdue period on the amount so placed as a  fresh term deposit. Banks will have the freedom to recover the interest so paid  for the overdue period if the deposit is withdrawn before completion of the  minimum stipulated period under the Scheme, after renewal.
2.7
Crystallisation of Inoperative Foreign  Currency Deposits
In  terms of
A.P. (DIR Series) circular No. 136 dated May 28, 2014
, issued by our  Foreign Exchange Department, Authorised Dealer Banks shall crystallise, that  is, convert the credit balances in any inoperative foreign currency denominated  deposit into Indian Rupee, in the manner indicated below:
(i) In case a foreign currency denominated deposit with a  fixed maturity date  remains  inoperative for a period of three years from the date of maturity of the  deposit, at the end of the third year,  the authorised bank shall convert the  balances  lying in the foreign currency denominated deposit into Indian Rupee at the  exchange rate prevailing as on that date. Thereafter, the depositor shall be  entitled to claim either the said Indian Rupee proceeds and interest thereon,  if any, or the foreign currency equivalent (calculated at the rate prevalent as  on the date of payment) of the Indian Rupee proceeds of the original deposit  and interest, if any, on such Indian Rupee proceeds.
(ii)  In case of foreign currency denominated deposit with no fixed maturity period,  if the deposit remains inoperative for a period of three years (debit of bank  charges not to be reckoned as operation), the authorised bank shall,  after giving a three month notice to  the depositor at his last known address as available with it, convert the  deposit from the foreign currency in which it is denominated to Indian Rupee at  the end of the notice period at the prevailing exchange rate. Thereafter, the  depositor shall be entitled to claim either the said Indian Rupee proceeds and  interest thereon, if any, or the foreign currency equivalent (calculated at the  rate prevalent as on the date of payment) of the Indian Rupee proceeds of the  original deposit and interest, if any, on such Indian Rupee proceeds.
2.8
Advances against FCNR(B) deposits -  Manner of charging interest
(i) When a loan or an advance is granted  against an FCNR(B) term deposit which stands in the name of a borrower either  singly or jointly, a bank would be free to charge a rate of interest without reference to its own Base Rate
(ii) When a loan or advance is granted  out of resources mobilised under the Scheme, interest rate chargeable should be  at the rate as prescribed in terms of Reserve Bank of India’s  directive relating to Interest Rates on Advances.
2.9
Restrictions  on advances against FCNR(B) deposits -
Quantum  of loans
With effect from April 28, 2009, banks were permitted  to grant advance upto Rs. 100 lakh on  loans against security of funds held in NR(E)RA and FCNR(B) deposits either to  the depositors or third parties.
With effect from October 12, 2012, banks may  grant loans against NR(E)RA and FCNR(B) deposits either to the depositors or  the third parties as under:-
Existing    provision
Revised    provision
Rupee    loans* in India
Loans against NRE/FCNR(B) Fixed Deposits
Rs. 100 lakhs ceiling applicable
Rupee loans to be allowed to    depositor/third party without any ceiling subject to usual margin    requirements**
Foreign Currency loan* in India/ outside India
Loans against NRE/FCNR(B) Fixed Deposits
Rs. 100 lakhs ceiling applicable
Foreign Currency loans to be allowed to    depositor/third party without any ceiling subject to usual margin    requirements **
* The term ‘loan’ shall include all types  of fund based/non-fund based facilities.
** In case of FCNR (B) deposits the  margin requirement shall be notionally calculated on the rupee equivalent of  the deposits in accordance with para 9(2) of Schedule-2 of Foreign Exchange  Management (Deposit) Regulations, 2000.
Further, the facility of premature  withdrawal of NRE/FCNR deposits shall not be available where loans against such  deposits are to be availed of. This requirement may specifically be brought to  the notice of the deposit holder at the time of sanction of the loan. The  existing loans which are not in conformity with the above instructions shall  continue for their existing term and shall not be rolled over/renewed. Other  conditions as regards grant of loan against NRE/FCNR deposits shall remain  unchanged.
2.10
Interest payable on the deposit of a  deceased depositor
In  the case of a term deposit standing in the name/s of -
i) a deceased individual  depositor, or
ii) two or more joint  depositors, where one of the depositors has died, interest should be paid in  the manner indicated below :
at the contracted  rate on the maturity of the deposit;
in the event of the  payment of the deposit being claimed before the  maturity date, the bank should pay interest at an applicable rate  prevailing on the date of placement of the deposit, without charging penalty;
in the event of death  of the depositor before the date of maturity of the deposit and the amount of  the deposit being claimed after the date of maturity, the bank should pay  interest at the contracted rate till the date of maturity. From the date of  maturity to the date of payment, the bank should pay simple interest at the  applicable rate operative on the date of maturity, for the period for which the  deposit remained with the bank beyond the date of maturity. However, in the  case of death of the depositor after the date of maturity of the deposit, the  bank should pay interest at a rate operative on the date of maturity in respect  of savings deposits held under RFC Account Scheme, from the date of maturity  till the date of payment;
if, on request from  the claimant/s, the bank agrees to split the amount of term deposit and issues  two or more receipts individually in the name/s of the claimant/s, it should  not be construed as premature withdrawal of the term deposit for the purpose of  levy of penalty provided the period and aggregate amount of the deposit do not  undergo any change.
Note
: In the case of claimant/s being residents, the  maturity proceeds may be converted into Indian rupees on the date of maturity  and interest be paid for the subsequent period at the rate applicable to a  deposit of similar maturity under the domestic deposit scheme.
2.11
Addition or deletion of name/s of  joint account holders
A bank may, at the request of all the  joint holders, allow the addition or deletion of name/s of joint account  holder/s if the circumstances so warrant or allow an individual depositor to  add the name of another person as a joint holder. However, in no case should  the amount or duration of the original deposit undergo a change in any manner  whatsoever. The bank should ascertain the reasons from the applicants for doing  so and also satisfy themselves about the bona fide nature of the request.  Further, opening of FCNR(B)  accounts jointly with a resident as well as opening of accounts in the  names of Pakistani/Bangladeshi nationals, though of Indian origin, will be subject to the  instructions issued by Foreign Exchange Department, Reserve Bank of India from time to time.
2.12
Payment of interest on FCNR(B) deposits of  NRIs on return to India
Banks may allow  FCNR(B) deposits of persons of Indian nationality/origin who return to India for  permanent settlement to continue till maturity at the contracted rate of  interest, if desired. Except the  provision relating to rate of interest and reserve requirements as applicable  to FCNR(B) deposits, for all other purposes, such deposits should be treated as  resident deposits from the date of return of the account holder to India.  Premature withdrawal of such FCNR(B) deposits should be subject to penal  provisions of the Scheme. Banks should convert the FCNR(B) deposits on maturity into Resident Rupee Deposit  Account or RFC Account (if eligible) at the option of the account holder. The  rate of interest on the new deposit (Rupee account or RFC Account) should be  the relevant rate applicable for such deposit account.
2.13
Conversion  of FCNR(B) Accounts of Returning Indians into RFC Account - Waiver of penalty
The penal provisions  would not be applicable in the case of premature conversion of balances held in  FCNR(B) deposits into RFC Accounts by  Non-Resident Indians on their return to India.
2.14
Conversion of FCNR(B) Accounts of Returning  Indians into RFC Accounts/Resident  Rupee Accounts- Payment of interest
A bank should pay  interest at its discretion at the time of conversion of FCNR(B) Account into  RFC/Resident Rupee Account even if the same has not run for a minimum maturity  period, subject to the condition that the rate of interest should not exceed  the rate payable on savings bank deposits held under RFC Account Scheme.
2.15
Payment  of interest on term deposit maturing on Saturday/Sunday/ holiday/non-business working day
In case  of reinvestment deposits, banks should pay interest for the intervening  Saturday/Sunday/holiday/non-business working day on the maturity value.  However, in the case of ordinary term deposits, the interest for the  intervening Saturday/Sunday/holiday/non-business working day should be paid on  the original principal amount.
2.16
Prohibitions
No  bank should:
(i) accept  or renew a deposit over five years.
(ii) discriminate  in the matter of rate of interest paid on the deposits, between one deposit and another  accepted on the same date and for the same maturity, whether such deposits are  accepted at the same office or at different offices of the bank, except on the  size group basis. The permission to offer varying rates of interest based on  size of the deposits will be subject to the following conditions:
Banks  should, at their discretion, decide the currency-wise minimum quantum on which  differential rates of interest may be offered. For term deposits below the  prescribed quantum with the same maturity, the same rate should apply.
The  differential rates of interest so offered should be subject to the overall  ceiling prescribed.
Interest  rates paid by the bank should be as per the schedule  and not subject to negotiation between the depositor and the bank.
(iii) pay brokerage, commission or incentives on  deposits mobilized under FCNR(B) Scheme in any form to any individual, firm,  company, association, institution or any other person.
