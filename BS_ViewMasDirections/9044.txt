Dear  Sir / Madam
Master  Circular on Wilful Defaulters
RBI  has been receiving references from banks and other agencies seeking  clarification as well as posing certain issues concerning the various  guidelines contained in the current Master Circular on Wilful Defaulters. These  references have been examined and the Master Circular has been modified  accordingly.
A copy of the same is attached
.
2. While  quite a few of the modifications in the guidelines are definitional and  clarificatory in nature, certain substantive changes have been made to bring in  greater transparency and accountability in the due process required to be  adopted for identification of Wilful Defaulters (paragraph 2.5(d) and 3). Further,  in view of the limited role of non-promoter/non-whole time directors (Nominee  and Independent directors) in the management of a company’s debt contracts,  their names shall now be excluded from the list of Wilful Defaulters, except in  the rarest circumstances which also have been specified at paragraph 3 of the Master  Circular.
3. The  modifications to the Master Circular have been furnished separately in the
Annex
.
Yours  faithfully,
(Sudarshan  Sen)
Chief  General Manager-in-Charge
Annex
Modifications  to Master Circular on ‘Wilful Defaulters’
(i) The  meanings of terms ‘Lender’ and ‘Unit’ have been clarified at paragraph 2.1 as  per the circular dated September 9, 2014 on Guidelines on Wilful Defaulters.
(ii) Paragraph  2.2.1(c) has been changed as below:
Transferring  borrowed funds to the subsidiaries / Group companies or other corporates by  whatever modalities
(iii) Paragraph  2.5(d) has been changed as below:
A  covenant in the loan agreements with the companies in which the banks/FIs have  significant stake, should be incorporated by the banks/FIs to the effect that  the borrowing company should not induct on its board a person whose name  appears in the list of Wilful Defaulters and that in case, such a person is  found to be on its board, it would take expeditious and effective steps for removal  of the person from its board. It would be imperative on the part of the banks  and FIs to put in place a transparent mechanism for the entire process so that  the penal provisions are not misused and the scope of such discretionary powers  are kept to the barest minimum. It should also be ensured that a solitary or  isolated instance is not made the basis for imposing the penal action.
(iv) Paragraph  2.6 on guarantees furnished by individuals, group companies and non-group companies  have been modified as per the circular ‘Guidelines on Wilful Defaulters –  Clarification regarding Guarantor, Lender and Unit’ dated September 9, 2014.
(v) Paragraph  3 on ‘Grievances Redressal Mechanism’ would now be titled ‘Mechanism for  identification of Wilful Defaulters’ and read as below:
The  transparent mechanism referred to in paragraph 2.5(d) above should generally  include the following:
The evidence of wilful default on  the part of the borrowing company and its promoter/whole-time director at the  relevant time should be examined by a Committee headed by an Executive Director  and consisting of two other senior officers of the rank of GM/DGM.
If the Committee concludes that an  event of wilful default has occurred, it shall issue a Show Cause Notice to the  concerned borrower and the promoter/whole-time director and call for their  submissions and after considering their submissions issue an order recording  the fact of wilful default and the reasons for the same. An opportunity should  be given to the borrower and the promoter/whole-time director for a personal  hearing if the Committee feels such an opportunity is necessary.
The Order of the Committee should be  reviewed by another Committee headed by the Chairman / CEO and MD and  consisting, in addition, of two independent directors of the Bank and the Order  shall become final only after it is confirmed by the said Review Committee.
As regard a non-promoter/non-whole time  director, it should be kept in mind that Section 2(60) of the Companies Act,  2013 defines an officer who is in default to mean only the following categories  of directors:
Whole-time  director
where  there is no key managerial personnel, such director or directors as specified  by the Board in this behalf and who has or have given his or their consent in  writing to the Board to such specification, or all the directors, if no  director is so specified;
every director, in respect of a contravention of  any of the provisions of this Act, who is aware of such contravention by virtue  of the receipt by him of any proceedings of the Board or participation in such  proceedings and who has not objected to the same, or where such contravention  had taken place with his consent or connivance.
Therefore,  except in very rare cases, a non-whole time director should not be considered  as a wilful defaulter unless it is conclusively established that
I. he  was aware of the fact of wilful default by the borrower by virtue of any  proceedings recorded in the Minutes of the Board or a Committee of the Board  and has not recorded his objection to the same in the Minutes, or,
II. the  wilful default had taken place with his consent or connivance.
A  similar process as detailed in sub paras (a) to (c) above should be followed  when identifying a non-promoter/non-whole time director as a wilful defaulter.
(vi) Paragraph  5.1 on ‘Need for ensuring Accuracy’ with  respect to reporting would read as below:
RBI  / Credit Information Companies disseminate information on non-suit filed and  suit filed accounts respectively of Wilful Defaulters, as reported to them by  the banks / FIs and therefore, the responsibility for reporting correct  information and also accuracy of facts and figures rests with the concerned  banks and financial institutions.
(vii) Paragraph  5.2 has now been titled ‘Position regarding guarantors’ and contains instructions  issued vide the circular dated September 9, 2014. Position regarding  Independent and Nominee Directors has now been incorporated in paragraph 3.
(viii) Remark  (e) against field 11 of Annex 1 is deleted as it is no longer required.

1. Introduction
Pursuant  to the instructions of the Central Vigilance Commission for collection of  information on wilful defaults of Rs.25 lakhs and above by RBI and  dissemination to the reporting banks and FIs, a scheme was framed by RBI with  effect from 1st April 1999 under which the banks and notified All India  Financial Institutions were required to submit to RBI the details of the wilful  defaulters. Wilful default broadly covered the following:
a)  Deliberate non-payment of the dues despite adequate cash flow and good  networth;
b)  Siphoning off of funds to the detriment of the defaulting unit;
c)  Assets financed either not been purchased or been sold and proceeds have been  misutilised;
d)  Misrepresentation / falsification of records;
e) Disposal  / removal of securities without bank's knowledge;
f)  Fraudulent transactions by the borrower.
Accordingly,  banks and FIs started reporting all cases of wilful defaults, which occurred or  were detected after 31st March 1999 on a quarterly basis. It covered all  non-performing borrowal accounts with outstandings (funded facilities and such  non-funded facilities which are converted into funded facilities) aggregating  Rs.25 lakhs and above identified as wilful default by a Committee of higher  functionaries headed by the Executive Director and consisting of two GMs/DGMs.  Banks/FIs were advised that they should examine all cases of wilful defaults of  Rs 1.00 crore and above for filing of suits and also consider criminal action  wherever instances of cheating/fraud by the defaulting borrowers were detected.  In case of consortium/multiple lending, banks and FIs were advised that they  report wilful defaults to other participating/financing banks also. Cases of  wilful defaults at overseas branches are required to be reported if such  disclosure is permitted under the laws of the host country.
2. Guidelines issued on wilful defaulters
Further,  considering the concerns expressed over the persistence of wilful default in  the financial system in the 8th Report of the Parliament's Standing Committee  on Finance on Financial Institutions, the Reserve Bank of India, in  consultation with the Government of India, constituted in May 2001 a Working  Group on Wilful Defaulters (WGWD) under the Chairmanship of Shri S. S. Kohli, the  then Chairman of the Indian Banks' Association, for examining some of the  recommendations of the Committee. The Group submitted its report in November  2001. The recommendations of the WGWD were further examined by an In House  Working Group constituted by the Reserve Bank. Accordingly, the Scheme was  further revised by RBI on May 30, 2002.
The  above scheme was in addition to the Scheme of Disclosure of Information on  Defaulting Borrowers of banks and FIs introduced in April 1994, vide RBI  Circular DBOD.No.BC/CIS/47/20.16.002/94 dated 23 April 1994.
2.1 Definition of wilful default
The term ‘lender’  appearing in the circular covers all banks/FIs to which any amount is due,  provided it is arising on account of any banking transaction, including off  balance sheet transactions such as derivatives, guarantee and Letter of Credit.
The term ‘unit’  appearing therein has to be taken to include individuals, juristic persons and  all other forms of business enterprises, whether incorporated or not. In case  of business enterprises (other than companies), banks/FIs may also report (in  the Director column) the names of those persons who are in charge and  responsible for the management of the affairs of the business enterprise.
The  term "wilful default" has been redefined in supersession of the  earlier definition as under:
A  "wilful default" would be deemed to have occurred if any of the  following events is noted:-
(a)  The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligations to the  lender even when it has the capacity to honour the said obligations.
(b)  The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligations to the  lender and has not utilised the finance from the lender for the specific  purposes for which finance was availed of but has diverted the funds for other  purposes.
(c)  The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligations to the  lender and has siphoned off the funds so that the funds have not been utilised  for the specific purpose for which finance was availed of, nor are the funds  available with the unit in the form of other assets.
(d)  The unit has defaulted in meeting its payment / repayment obligations to the  lender and has also disposed off or removed the movable fixed assets or  immovable property given by him or it for the purpose of securing a term loan  without the knowledge of the bank/lender.
2.2  Diversion and siphoning of funds
The  terms “diversion of funds” and “siphoning of funds” should construe to mean the  following:-
2.2.1  Diversion of funds, referred to at para 2.1(b) above, would be construed to  include any one of the undernoted occurrences:
(a)  utilisation of short-term working capital funds for long-term purposes not in  conformity with the terms of sanction;
(b)  deploying borrowed funds for purposes / activities or creation of assets other  than those for which the loan was sanctioned;
(c)  transferring borrowed funds to the subsidiaries / Group companies or other  corporates by whatever modalities;
(d)  routing of funds through any bank other than the lender bank or members of  consortium without prior permission of the lender;
(e)  investment in other companies by way of acquiring equities / debt instruments  without approval of lenders;
(f)  shortfall in deployment of funds vis-à-vis the amounts disbursed / drawn and  the difference not being accounted for.
2.2.2  Siphoning of funds, referred to at para 2.1(c) above, should be construed to  occur if any funds borrowed from banks / FIs are utilised for purposes  un-related to the operations of the borrower, to the detriment of the financial  health of the entity or of the lender. The decision as to whether a particular  instance amounts to siphoning of funds would have to be a judgement of the  lenders based on objective facts and circumstances of the case.
The  identification of the wilful default should be made keeping in view the track  record of the borrowers and should not be decided on the basis of isolated  transactions/incidents. The default to be categorised as wilful must be  intentional, deliberate and calculated.
2.3  Cut-off limits
While  the penal measures indicated at para 2.5 below would normally be attracted by  all the borrowers identified as wilful defaulters or the promoters involved in  diversion / siphoning of funds, keeping in view the present limit of Rs. 25  lakh fixed by the Central Vigilance Commission for reporting of cases of wilful  default by the banks/FIs to RBI, any wilful defaulter with an outstanding  balance of Rs. 25 lakh or more, would attract the penal measures stipulated at  para 2.5 below. This limit of Rs. 25 lakh may also be applied for the purpose  of taking cognisance of the instances of 'siphoning' / 'diversion' of funds.
2.4  End-use of Funds
In  cases of project financing, the banks / FIs seek to ensure end use of funds by,
inter alia
, obtaining certification from the Chartered Accountants for  the purpose. In case of short-term corporate / clean loans, such an approach  ought to be supplemented by 'due diligence' on the part of lenders themselves,  and to the extent possible, such loans should be limited to only those  borrowers whose integrity and reliability are above board. The banks and FIs,  therefore, should not depend entirely on the certificates issued by the  Chartered Accountants but strengthen their internal controls and the credit  risk management system to enhance the quality of their loan portfolio.
Needless  to say, ensuring end-use of funds by the banks and the FIs should form a part  of their loan policy document for which appropriate measures should be put in  place. The following are some of the illustrative measures that could be taken  by the lenders for monitoring and ensuring end-use of funds:
(a)  Meaningful scrutiny of quarterly progress reports / operating statements /  balance sheets of the borrowers;
(b)  Regular inspection of borrowers’ assets charged to the lenders as security;
(c)  Periodical scrutiny of borrowers’ books of accounts and the no-lien accounts  maintained with other banks;
(d)  Periodical visits to the assisted units;
(e)  System of periodical stock audit, in case of working capital finance;
(f)  Periodical comprehensive management audit of the ‘Credit’ function of the  lenders, so as to identify the systemic-weaknesses in the  credit-administration.
(It  may be kept in mind that this list of measures is only illustrative and by no  means exhaustive.)
2.5  Penal measures
In  order to prevent the access to the capital markets by the wilful defaulters, a  copy of the list of wilful defaulters (non-suit filed accounts) and list of  wilful defaulters (suit filed accounts) are forwarded to SEBI by RBI and Credit  Information Bureau (India) Ltd. (CIBIL) respectively.
The  following measures should be initiated by the banks and FIs against the wilful  defaulters identified as per the definition indicated at paragraph 2.1 above:
a)  No additional facilities should be granted by any bank / FI to the listed  wilful defaulters. In addition, the entrepreneurs / promoters of companies  where banks / FIs have identified siphoning / diversion of funds,  misrepresentation, falsification of accounts and fraudulent transactions should  be debarred from institutional finance from the scheduled commercial banks,  Development Financial Institutions, Government owned NBFCs, investment  institutions etc. for floating new ventures for a period of 5 years from the  date the name of the wilful defaulter is published in the list of wilful  defaulters by the RBI.
b)  The legal process, wherever warranted, against the borrowers / guarantors and  foreclosure of recovery of dues should be initiated expeditiously. The lenders  may initiate criminal proceedings against wilful defaulters, wherever  necessary.
c)  Wherever possible, the banks and FIs should adopt a proactive approach for a  change of management of the wilfully defaulting borrower unit.
d) A  covenant in the loan agreements with the companies in which the banks/FIs have  significant stake, should be incorporated by the banks/FIs to the effect that  the borrowing company should not induct on its board a person whose name  appears in the list of Wilful Defaulters and that in case, such a person is  found to be on its board, it would take expeditious and effective steps for  removal of the person from its board. It would be imperative on the part of the  banks and FIs to put in place a transparent mechanism for the entire process so  that the penal provisions are not misused and the scope of such discretionary  powers are kept to the barest minimum. It should also be ensured that a  solitary or isolated instance is not made the basis for imposing the penal  action.
2.6 Guarantees furnished by individuals, group  companies & non-group companies
While  dealing with wilful default of a single borrowing company in a Group, the banks  /FIs should consider the track record of the individual company, with reference  to its repayment performance to its lenders. However, in cases where guarantees  furnished by the companies within the Group on behalf of the wilfully  defaulting units are not honoured when invoked by the banks /FIs, such Group  companies should also be reckoned as wilful defaulters.
In  connection with the guarantors, banks have raised queries regarding inclusion  of names of guarantors who are either individuals (not being directors of the  company) or non-group corporates in the list of wilful defaulters. It is  advised that in terms of Section 128 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, the  liability of the surety is co-extensive with that of the principal debtor  unless it is otherwise provided by the contract. Therefore, when a default is  made in making repayment by the principal debtor, the banker will be able to  proceed against the guarantor/surety even without exhausting the remedies  against the principal debtor. As such, where a banker has made a claim on the guarantor  on account of the default made by the principal debtor, the liability of the  guarantor is immediate. In case the said guarantor refuses to comply with the  demand made by the creditor/banker, despite having sufficient means to make  payment of the dues, such guarantor would also be treated as a wilful  defaulter. It is clarified that this treatment of non-group corporate and  individual guarantors would apply only prospectively and not to cases where  guarantees were taken prior to this circular. Banks/FIs may ensure that this  position is made known to all prospective guarantors at the time of accepting  guarantees.
2.7  Role of auditors
In  case any falsification of accounts on the part of the borrowers is observed by  the banks / FIs, and if it is observed that the auditors were negligent or  deficient in conducting the audit, they should lodge a formal complaint against  the auditors of the borrowers with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of  India (ICAI) to enable the ICAI to examine and fix accountability of the  auditors. Pending disciplinary action by ICAI, the complaints may also be  forwarded to the RBI (Department of Banking Supervision, Central Office) and  IBA for records. IBA would circulate the names of the CA firms against whom  many complaints have been received amongst all banks who should consider this  aspect before assigning any work to them. RBI would also share such information  with other financial sector regulators/Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) /  Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).
With  a view to monitoring the end-use of funds, if the lenders desire a specific  certification from the borrowers’ auditors regarding diversion / siphoning of  funds by the borrower, the lender should award a separate mandate to the  auditors for the purpose. To facilitate such certification by the auditors the  banks and FIs will also need to ensure that appropriate covenants in the loan  agreements are incorporated to enable award of such a mandate by the lenders to  the borrowers / auditors.
In  addition to the above, banks are advised that with a view to ensuring proper  end-use of funds and preventing diversion/siphoning of funds by the borrowers,  lenders could consider engaging their own auditors for such specific  certification purpose without relying on certification given by borrower’s  auditors. However, this cannot substitute bank’s basic minimum own diligence in  the matter.
2.8  Role of Internal Audit / Inspection
The  aspect of diversion of funds by the borrowers should be adequately looked into  while conducting internal audit / inspection of their offices / branches and  periodical reviews on cases of wilful defaults should be submitted to the Audit  Committee of the bank.
2.9  Reporting to RBI / Credit Information Companies
(a)  Banks/FIs should submit the list of suit-filed accounts of wilful defaulters of  Rs.25 lakh and above as at end-March, June, September and December every year  to a credit information company which has obtained certificate of registration  from RBI in terms of Section 5 of the Credit Information Companies (Regulation)  Act, 2005 and of which it is a member. Reserve Bank of India has, in exercise  of the powers conferred by the Act and the Rules and Regulations framed  thereunder, granted Certificate of Registration to (i) Experian Credit Information  Company of India Private Limited, (ii) Equifax Credit Information Services  Private Limited, (iii) CRIF High Mark Credit Information Services Private  Limited and (iv) Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL) to  commence/carry on the business of credit information. Credit Information  Companies (CICs) have also been advised to disseminate the information  pertaining to suit filed accounts of Wilful Defaulters on their respective  websites.
(b)  Banks / FIs should, however, submit the quarterly list of wilful defaulters  where suits have not been filed only to RBI in the format given in Annex 1.
(c)  In order to make the current system of banks/FIs reporting names of suit filed  accounts and non-suit filed accounts of Wilful Defaulters and its availability  to the banks by CICs / RBI as current as possible, banks / FIs are advised to  forward data on wilful defaulters to the CICs/Reserve Bank at the earliest but  not later than a month from the reporting date.
d)  After examining the recommendations of the Committee to Recommend Data Format  for Furnishing of Credit Information to Credit Information Companies (Chairman:  Shri. Aditya Puri) it has been decided to implement the following measures with  regard to reporting and dissemination of information on wilful defaulters:
Banks/FIs       may continue to furnish the data on wilful defaulters (non-suit filed       accounts) of Rs. 25 lakhs and above for the quarter ending June 30, 2014       and September 30, 2014 to RBI in the existing format.
In terms of Credit Information Companies  (Regulation) Act, 2005, banks/FIs are advised to furnish the aforementioned  data in respect of wilful defaulters (non-suit filed accounts) of Rs. 25 lakhs  and above for the quarter ending December 31, 2014 to CICs and not to RBI.  Thereafter, banks/FIs may continue to furnish data in respect of wilful  defaulters to CICs on a monthly or a more frequent basis. This would enable  such information to be available to the banks/FIs on a near real time basis.
Explanation
In  this connection, it is clarified that banks need not report cases where
(i)  outstanding amount falls below Rs.25 lakh and
(ii)  in respect of cases where banks have agreed for a compromise settlement and the  borrower has fully paid the compromised amount.
3. Mechanism  for identification of Wilful Defaulters
The  transparent mechanism referred to in paragraph 2.5(d) above should generally  include the following:
(a) The evidence of wilful default on the  part of the borrowing company and its promoter/whole-time director at the  relevant time should be examined by a Committee headed by an Executive Director  and consisting of two other senior officers of the rank of GM/DGM.
(b) If the Committee concludes that an event  of wilful default has occurred, it shall issue a Show Cause Notice to the  concerned borrower and the promoter/whole-time director and call for their  submissions and after considering their submissions issue an order recording  the fact of wilful default and the reasons for the same. An opportunity should  be given to the borrower and the promoter/whole-time director for a personal  hearing if the Committee feels such an opportunity is necessary.
(c) The Order of the Committee should be  reviewed by another Committee headed by the Chairman / CEO and MD and  consisting, in addition, of two independent directors of the Bank and the Order  shall become final only after it is confirmed by the said Review Committee.
(d) As regard a non-promoter/non-whole time  director, it should be kept in mind that Section 2(60) of the Companies Act,  2013 defines an officer who is in default to mean only the following categories  of directors:
(i) Whole-time director
(ii) where there is no key managerial  personnel, such director or directors as specified by the Board in this behalf  and who has or have given his or their consent in writing to the Board to such  specification, or all the directors, if no director is so specified;
(iii) every director, in respect of a  contravention of any of the provisions of this Act, who is aware of such  contravention by virtue of the receipt by him of any proceedings of the Board  or participation in such proceedings and who has not objected to the same, or  where such contravention had taken place with his consent or connivance.
Therefore,  except in very rare cases, a non-whole time director should not be considered  as a wilful defaulter unless it is conclusively established that
I. he was aware of the fact of wilful  default by the borrower by virtue of any proceedings recorded in the Minutes of  the Board or a Committee of the Board and has not recorded his objection to the  same in the Minutes, or,
II. the wilful default had taken place with  his consent or connivance.
A  similar process as detailed in sub paras (a) to (c) above should be followed  when identifying a non-promoter/non-whole time director as a wilful defaulter.
4.  Criminal Action against Wilful Defaulters
4.1  J.P.C. Recommendations
Reserve  Bank examined, the issues relating to restraining wilful defaults in  consultation with the Standing Technical Advisory Committee on Financial  Regulation in the context of the following recommendations of the JPC and in  particular, on the need for initiating criminal action against concerned  borrowers, viz.
a.  It is essential that offences of breach of trust or cheating construed to have  been committed in the case of loans should be clearly defined under the  existing statutes governing the banks, providing for criminal action in all  cases where the borrowers divert the funds with malafide intentions.
b.  It is essential that banks closely monitor the end-use of funds and obtain  certificates from the borrowers certifying that the funds have been used for  the purpose for which these were obtained.
c.  Wrong certification should attract criminal action against the borrower.
4.2  Monitoring of End Use
Banks  / FIs should closely monitor the end-use of funds and obtain certificates from  borrowers certifying that the funds are utilised for the purpose for which they  were obtained. In case of wrong certification by the borrowers, banks / FIs may  consider appropriate legal proceedings, including criminal action wherever  necessary, against the borrowers.
4.3  Criminal Action by Banks / FIs
It  is essential to recognise that there is scope even under the existing  legislations to initiate criminal action against wilful defaulters depending  upon the facts and circumstances of the case under the provisions of Sections  403 and 415 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) 1860. Banks / FIs are, therefore,  advised to seriously and promptly consider initiating criminal action against  wilful defaulters or wrong certification by borrowers, wherever considered  necessary, based on the facts and circumstances of each case under the above  provisions of the IPC to comply with our instructions and the recommendations  of JPC.
It  should also be ensured that the penal provisions are used effectively and  determinedly but after careful consideration and due caution. Towards this end,  banks / FIs are advised to put in place a transparent mechanism, with the  approval of their Board, for initiating criminal proceedings based on the facts  of individual case.
5.  Reporting
5.1  Need for Ensuring Accuracy
RBI  / Credit Information Companies disseminate information on non-suit filed and  suit filed accounts respectively of Wilful Defaulters, as reported to them by  the banks / FIs and therefore, the responsibility for reporting correct  information and also accuracy of facts and figures rests with the concerned  banks and financial institutions.
5.2  Position regarding Guarantors
Banks/FIs  may take due care to follow the provisions set out in paragraph 3 of the Master  Circular on Wilful Defaulters dated July 1, 2014 in identifying and reporting  instances of wilful default in respect of guarantors also. While reporting such  names to RBI, banks/FIs may include “Guar” in brackets i.e. (Guar) against the  name of the guarantor and report the same in the Director column.
5.3  Government Undertakings
In  the case of Government undertakings, it should be ensured that the names of  directors are not to be reported. Instead, a legend "Government of  -------- undertaking" should be added.
5.4  Inclusion of Director Identification Number (DIN)
Ministry  of Corporate Affairs had introduced the concept of a Director Identification  Number (DIN) with the insertion of Sections 266A to 266G of Companies  (Amendment) Act, 2006. In order to ensure that directors are correctly  identified and in no case, persons whose names appear to be similar to the  names of directors appearing in the list of wilful defaulters, are wrongfully  denied credit facilities on such grounds, banks/FIs have been advised to  include the Director Identification Number (DIN) as one of the fields in the  data submitted by them to Reserve Bank of India / Credit Information Companies.
It  is reiterated that while carrying out the credit appraisal, banks should verify  as to whether the names of any of the directors of the companies appear in the  list of defaulters/ wilful defaulters by way of reference to DIN/PAN etc.  Further, in case of any doubt arising on account of identical names, banks  should use independent sources for confirmation of the identity of directors  rather than seeking declaration from the borrowing company.
