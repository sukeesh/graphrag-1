Madam/Dear Sir,
Know Your  Customer (KYC) Norms – Clarification on proof of address
Please refer to our
circular  UBD.BPD.(PCB).Cir.No.69/14.01.062/2013-14 dated June 10, 2014
on the  captioned subject. In this connection we  also draw your attention to our
circular  UBD. BPD (PCB). Cir.No. 16/14.01.062/2014-15 dated September 16, 2014
,  forwarding copies of a press release dated August 26, 2014, together with a  poster and a booklet on KYC simplification measures initiated by us.
2. In this regard, it has been  brought to our notice that despite issuing clear instructions regarding the  requirement of one proof of address whether permanent or current, some banks  are still insisting on submission of a proof of address for the current address  even when a customer produces a proof of permanent address, which prevents many  prospective customers, especially migrant workers, from opening bank accounts.
3. In view of the above, banks  are advised to ensure that customers are not unnecessarily asked to submit  additional proofs of addresses for current addresses in cases where proofs of  addresses for permanent addresses are already available. UCBs are requested to confirm  to our Regional Offices latest by October 31, 2014, that the above mentioned  instruction has been communicated to all their branches and the same have been  meticulously complied with.
Yours  faithfully
(Suma Varma)
Chief General Manager
