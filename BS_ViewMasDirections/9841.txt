The objectives of the PD system are to strengthen the infrastructure in G-Sec market, development of underwriting and market making capabilities for G-Sec, improve secondary market trading system and to make PDs an effective conduit for open market operations (OMO). As on June 30, 2015, there are seven standalone PDs and thirteen banks authorized to undertake PD business departmentally.
1.2 Eligibility conditions
1.2.1 The eligibility criteria for an entity to apply to the Reserve Bank of India for undertaking the activities of a PD are as under:
Eligible Institutions
Eligibility conditions

Previous experience in servicing mid-segment and retail customers in G-Secs will be viewed favourably while processing the application for PD authorisation.
1.2.2 An applicant will not be eligible for authorisation as a PD if, within the last one year, it has been subject to litigation or regulatory action or investigation that the Reserve Bank considers material or otherwise relevant to the business of PD. In making such determination, RBI may consult with the appropriate regulators for their views.
1.2.3 An entity satisfying the criteria stipulated above should submit its application to the Chief General Manager, Internal Debt Management Department (IDMD), RBI, Mumbai. The RBI will, if satisfied, grant ‘in principle approval’. The applicant will, thereafter, submit an undertaking in respect of the terms and conditions agreed to as per the prescribed format given in
Annex I
. Based on the application and undertaking, an authorisation letter will be issued by RBI. Continuation as a PD would depend on its compliance with the terms and conditions of authorisation.
1.2.4 The decision to authorise PDs will be taken by RBI based on its perception of market needs, suitability of the applicant and the likely value addition to the system.

Annex I
) and the authorization letter issued by RBI every three years. Undertaking will be based on passing of a fresh Board resolution by the PD every three years.
1.4 Facilities from RBI
The RBI currently extends the following facilities to the PDs to enable them to fulfill their obligations effectively:
access to Current Account facility with RBI;
access to Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) Account facility with RBI;

permission to borrow and lend in the money market including call money market and to trade in all money market instruments;
memberships of electronic dealing, trading and settlement systems (NDS platforms/INFINET/RTGS/CCIL);
access to the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) of RBI;
access to liquidity support from RBI under a scheme separately notified for standalone PDs; and
access to OMO by RBI.
The facilities are subject to review.
1.5 Regulation and Supervision by RBI
Operations of the PDs are subject to prudential and regulatory guidelines issued by RBI from time to time.
1.5.1 Returns:
As part of off-site supervision, PDs are required to submit prescribed periodic returns to RBI as per
Annex II–A
&
B
. RBI may also prescribe any other return as it may deem necessary.
1.5.2 On-Site Supervision:
RBI will have the right to inspect the books, records, documents and accounts of a PD. PDs are required to make available all such documents, records, etc. to the RBI officers and render all necessary assistance as and when required.
1.5.4 In addition, PDs are required to meet registration and such other requirements as stipulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) including operations on the Stock Exchanges, if they undertake any activity regulated by SEBI.
1.5.5 A PD should bring to the attention of RBI any major complaint against it or action initiated/taken against it by authorities such as the Stock Exchanges, SEBI, CBI, Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax Department, etc.
1.5.6 PDs are expected to join Primary Dealers Association of India (PDAI) and Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association (FIMMDA) and abide by the code of conduct framed by them and such other actions as initiated by them in the interest of the securities markets.
2. Primary Market Activities
PDs are expected to support the primary issues of dated securities of Central Government and State Government, T-Bills and CMBs through underwriting/bidding commitments. The related guidelines are as under:
2.1 Underwriting of Dated G-Sec
2.1.1 Dated securities of Central Government
The underwriting commitment on dated securities of Central Government will be divided into two parts - a) Minimum Underwriting Commitment (MUC), and b) Additional Competitive Underwriting (ACU).
The MUC of each PD will be computed to ensure that at least 50 percent of the notified amount of each issue is mandatorily underwritten equally by all the PDs. The share under MUC will be uniform for all PDs, irrespective of their capital or balance sheet size. The remaining portion of the notified amount will be underwritten through an ACU auction.
RBI will announce the MUC of each PD. In the ACU auction, each PD would be required to bid for an amount
at least
equal to its share of MUC. A PD cannot bid for more than 30 per cent of the notified amount in the ACU auction.
The auction could be either uniform price-based or multiple price-based depending upon the market conditions and other relevant factors, which will be announced before the underwriting auction for each issue.
Bids will be tendered by the PDs within the stipulated time, indicating both the amount of the underwriting commitment and underwriting commission rates. A PD can submit multiple bids for underwriting. Depending upon the bids submitted for underwriting, RBI will decide the cut-off rate of commission and inform the PDs.
Underwriting commission:
All successful bidders in the ACU auction will be paid underwriting commission on the ACU segment as per the auction rules. Those PDs who succeed in the ACU for 4 per cent and above of the notified amount of the issue, will be paid commission on the MUC at the weighted average of all the accepted bids in the ACU. Others will get commission on the MUC at the weighted average rate of the three lowest accepted bids in the ACU.
In the GOI securities auction, a PD should bid for an amount not less than its total underwriting obligation. If two or more issues are floated on the same day, the minimum bid amount will be applied to each issue separately.
Underwriting commission will be paid on the amount accepted for underwriting by the RBI, irrespective of the actual amount of devolvement, by credit to the current account of the respective PDs at the RBI, Fort, Mumbai, on the date of issue of security.
In case of devolvement, PDs would be allowed to set-off the accepted bids in the auction against their shortfall in underwriting commitment accepted by the RBI. Devolvement of securities, if any, on PDs will take place on pro-rata basis, depending upon the amount of underwriting obligation of each PD after setting off the successful bids in the auction.
RBI reserves the right to accept any amount of underwriting up to 100 per cent of the notified amount or even reject all the bids tendered by PDs for underwriting, without assigning any reason.
An illustration on underwriting procedure is given in Annex III.
2.1.2 Dated securities of State Governments
On announcement of an auction of State Development Loans (SDLs), which are dated securities of the State Governments, RBI may invite PDs to collectively bid to underwrite up to 100 per cent of the notified amount.
The auction could be either uniform price-based or multiple price-based depending upon the market conditions and other relevant factors, which will be announced before the underwriting auction for each issue.
A PD can bid to underwrite up to 30 per cent of the notified amount of the issue. If two or more issues are floated on the same day, the limit of 30% is applied by taking the notified amounts separately.
Bids will be tendered by PDs within the stipulated time, indicating both the amount of the underwriting commitments and underwriting commission rates. A PD can submit multiple bids for underwriting.
Depending upon the bids submitted for underwriting, the RBI will decide the cut-off rate of commission and the underwriting amount up to which bids would be accepted and inform the PDs.
RBI reserves the right to accept any amount of underwriting up to 100 per cent of the notified amount or even reject all the bids tendered by PDs for underwriting, without assigning any reason.
In case of devolvement, PDs would be allowed to set-off the accepted bids in the auction against their shortfall in underwriting commitment accepted by the RBI. Devolvement of securities, if any, on PDs will take place on pro-rata basis, depending upon the amount of underwriting obligation of each PD after setting off the successful bids in the auction.
Underwriting commission will be paid on the amount accepted for underwriting by the RBI, irrespective of the actual amount of devolvement, by credit to the current account of the respective PDs at the RBI, Fort, Mumbai, on the date of issue of security.
2.2 Bidding in Primary auctions of T-Bills/CMBs
Each PD will individually commit, at the beginning of the year (April – March), to submit bids for a fixed percentage of the notified amount of T-Bills/CMBs in each auction.
The minimum bidding commitment amount / percentage for each PD will be determined by the RBI, in consultation with the PD. While finalizing the bidding commitments, the RBI will take into account the NOF, the offer made by the PD, its track record and its past adherence to the prescribed success ratio. The amount/percentage of minimum bidding commitment so determined by the RBI will remain unchanged for the entire year or till execution of the undertaking for the next year.
In any auction of T-Bills/CMBs, if a PD fails to submit the required minimum bid or submits a bid lower than its commitment, the RBI may take appropriate penal action against the PD.
A PD would be required to achieve a minimum success ratio of 40 percent of bidding commitment in T-Bills/CMBs auctions (if an auction gets cancelled or if all bids are rejected by RBI then PD should not take that auction’s notified amount in the calculation of success ratio. Also, if RBI accepts partial amount, PD should take only accepted amount for calculation purpose) which will be monitored on a half yearly basis, i.e. April to September and October to March, separately (For illustrations please refer to
Annex IV
).
The CMB transactions may be reported in PDR returns along with the T-Bill transactions.
2.3 ‘When-Issued’ transactions in Central G-Sec
PDs shall adhere to the guidelines issued by the RBI vide
circular IDMD.No. 2130/11.01.01 (D)/2006-07 dated November 16, 2006
, as amended from time to time, for undertaking “When Issued” transactions.
2.4 Submission of client bids in the primary auctions
The PDs are allowed to submit bids of their SGL/Gilt account holders in the primary auctions as their own bids under competitive route after putting in place the following safeguards:
PDs should have a Board approved policy including appropriate risk management system to take care of risks arising out of such activity
List of clients, details of business done through such clients and appropriateness of risk management system put in place may be periodically reviewed by the Board.
Records maintained in this regard should be subjected to concurrent audit.
PDs may execute the secondary market sale transaction and report the same on NDS-OM (T+1 settlement). With respect to the dated securities, the sale transaction may be made within one hour of intimation of firm allotment in the primary auctions.
2.5 Submission of non-competitive bids
PDs shall adhere to the guidelines issued vide
circular RBI/2008-09/479 - IDMD.No.5877/ 08.02.33/2008-09 dated May 22, 2009

for undertaking sale of securities allotted in primary issues on the same day. PDs can avail services of brokers for carrying out such sale contracts.
2.7 Settlement of primary auctions
The primary auction settlement is independent from the secondary market settlements and therefore has to be funded separately. Successful PDs shall provide sufficient funds in their current account with the RBI on the auction settlement days before 3:00 pm to meet their obligations against the subscriptions in the primary auctions failing which the shortage will be treated as an instance of ‘SGL bouncing’ and will be subjected to the applicable penal provisions.
3. Secondary Market activities
3.1 Market making in G-Sec:
PDs should offer two-way prices in G-Sec through the Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching (NDS-OM), over-the-counter (OTC) market and recognized Stock Exchanges in India and take principal positions in the secondary market for G-Sec.
3.2 Turnover ratio:
A PD should annually achieve a minimum turnover ratio of 5 times for Government dated securities and 10 times for T-Bills/CMBs of the average month-end stocks. The turnover ratio in respect of outright transactions should not be less than 3 times in Government dated securities and 6 times in T-Bills/CMBs (Turnover ratio is the ratio of total purchase and sales during the year in the secondary market to average month-end stocks).
3.3 Secondary Market Transactions - Short-selling
PDs shall adhere to the guidelines issued by the RBI vide

circular FMRD.DIRD.06/14.03.007/2014-15 dated March 20, 2015
, as amended from time to time.
4 Liquidity Support from RBI
In addition to access to the RBI's LAF, standalone PDs are also provided with liquidity support by the RBI against eligible G-Sec including SDLs. The parameters based on which liquidity support will be allocated are given below:
Of the total liquidity support, half of the amount will be divided equally among all the standalone PDs. The remaining half (i.e. 50%) will be divided in the ratio of 1:1 based on market performance in primary market and secondary market. Performance in primary market will be computed on the basis of bids accepted in the T-Bill/CMB auctions and G-Sec auctions in the proportionate weights of 1 and 3. Similarly, the secondary market performance will be judged on the basis of outright turnover in T-Bills/CMBs and G-Sec in the proportionate weights of 1 and 3.
The PD-wise limit of liquidity support will be revised every half-year (April-September and October-March) based on the market performance of the PDs in the preceding six months.
The liquidity support will be made available at the ‘Repo Rate’ announced by the RBI.
The liquidity support availed by a PD will be repayable within a period of 90 days. If it is repaid after 90 days, the penal rate of interest payable by PDs is Bank rate plus 5 percentage points for the period beyond 90 days.
5. Investment Guidelines
5.1 Investment policy - PDs should frame and implement, a Board approved, investment policy and operational guidelines on securities transactions. The policy should contain the broad objectives to be followed while undertaking transactions in securities on their own account and on behalf of clients, clearly define the authority to put through deals, and lay down procedure to be followed while putting through deals, various prudential exposure limits, policy regarding dealings through brokers, systems for management of various risks, guidelines for valuation of the portfolio and the reporting systems etc. Operational procedures and controls in relation to the day-to-day business operations should also be worked out and put in place to ensure that operations in securities are conducted in accordance with sound and acceptable business practices. While laying down these guidelines, the PDs should strictly adhere to RBI’s instructions, issued from time to time. The effectiveness of the policy and operational guidelines should be periodically evaluated.
5.2 The investment in G-Sec should have predominance over the non-core activities in terms of investment pattern. Standalone PDs are required to ensure predominance by maintaining at least 50 per cent of their total financial investments (both long term and short term) in G-Sec at any point of time. Investment in G-Sec will include the PD’s Own Stock, Stock with RBI under Liquidity Support / Intra-day Liquidity (IDL)/ LAF, Stock with market for repo borrowings and G-Sec pledged with the CCIL.
5.3 Further, a PD’s investment in G-Sec (including T-Bills and CMBs) and Corporate Bond (to the extent of 50% of NOF) on a daily basis should be at least equal to its net call/notice/repo (including CBLO) borrowing plus net RBI borrowing (through LAF/ Intra-Day Liquidity/ Liquidity Support) plus the minimum prescribed NOF.
5.4 PDs should necessarily hold their investments in G-Sec portfolio in SGL with RBI. They may also have a dematerialised (Demat) account with depositories – National Securities Depository Limited / Central Depository Services (India) Limited. All purchase/sale transactions in G-Secs by PDs should be through SGL / Constituent SGL (CSGL) / Demat accounts.
5.5 PDs should hold all other investments such as CPs, bonds and debentures (privately placed or otherwise) and equity instruments, only in demat form.
5.6 All problem exposures, which are not backed by any security or backed by security of doubtful value, should be fully provided for. Where a PD has filed suit against another party for recovery, such exposures should be evaluated and provisions made to the satisfaction of auditors. Any claim against the PD should also be taken note of and provisions made to the satisfaction of auditors.
5.7 The profit and loss account should reflect the problem exposures if any, and also the effect of valuation of portfolio, as per the instructions issued by the RBI, from time to time. The report of the statutory auditors should contain a certification to this effect.
5.8 HTM Portfolio
5.8.1 Standalone PDs are allowed to categorize a portion of their G-Sec portfolio in the HTM category, subject to the following conditions:
The transfer of securities (both Central Government and State Government) to/from HTM portfolio shall be done as per the policy formulated by the Board. Such transfers shall be permitted only once in a quarter.
Transfer of securities to/from HTM portfolio should be done with the approval of the Board at the acquisition cost/ book value/ market value on the date of transfer, whichever is the least, and the depreciation, if any, on such transfer shall be fully provided for. PDs are allowed to shift investments to/from HTM portfolio with the approval of the MD of the PD/Head of ALCO, only in case of exigencies. However, it should be ratified by the Board.
Only securities acquired by the PD under primary auction will be eligible for classification under HTM category.
The quantum of securities that can be classified as HTM shall be restricted to 100% of the audited NOF of the PD as at the end March of the preceding financial year.
The profit on sale of securities, if any, from the HTM category shall first be taken to the P & L Account and thereafter be appropriated to the “Reserve Account”; loss on sale shall be recognized in the P & L Account.
Investments classified under HTM will be carried at acquisition cost, unless it is more than the face value, in which case the premium should be amortized over the remaining period to maturity. The book value of the security should continue to be reduced to the extent of the amount amortized during the relevant accounting period.
The concurrent auditors should specifically verify compliance with these instructions.
The facility shall be available until further advice.
5.8.2 Banks undertaking PD activities departmentally may continue to follow the extant guidelines applicable to banks with regard to the classification and valuation of the investment portfolio issued by Department of Banking Regulation (DBR), RBI.
6 Systems/Controls
6.1 Purchase/Sale of securities through SGL transfer forms
All PDs should report / conclude their transactions on NDS / NDS-OM and clear/settle them through CCIL as central counter-party. In such cases where exceptions have been permitted to tender physical SGL transfer forms, the following guidelines should be followed:
Records of all SGL transfer forms issued/received should be maintained and a system for verification of the authenticity of the SGL transfer forms received from the counter-party and confirmation of authorized signatories should be put in place.
Under no circumstances, a SGL transfer form issued by a PD in favour of counterparty should bounce for want of sufficient balance in the SGL/Current Account. Any instance of return of SGL form from the Public Debt Office (PDO) of the RBI for want of sufficient balance in the account should be immediately brought to the notice of the PD’s top management and reported to RBI with the details of transactions.
SGL Transfer forms received by purchasing PDs should be deposited in their SGL Accounts immediately. No sale should be effected by way of return of SGL form held by the PD.
SGL transfer form should be in a standard format, prescribed by the RBI, and printed on semi-security paper of uniform size. They should be serially numbered and there should be a control system in place to account for each SGL form.
6.2 Bank Receipt or similar receipt should not be issued or accepted by the PDs under any circumstances in respect of transactions in G-Sec.
6.3 Reconciliation of holdings of G-Sec
Balances as per books of PDs should be reconciled at least at monthly intervals with the balances in the books of PDOs. If the number of transactions so warrant, the reconciliation should be undertaken at more frequent intervals. This reconciliation should be periodically verified during concurrent/internal audit of the PDs.
6.4 Transactions on behalf of Constituents
The PDs should undertake all due diligence while acting as agent of their clients for carrying out transactions in securities.
PDs should not use the constituents’ funds or assets for proprietary trading or for financing of another intermediary’s operations.
All transaction records should give a clear indication that the transaction belongs to constituent and does not belong to PD’s own account.
The transactions on behalf of constituents and the operations in the CSGL accounts should be conducted in accordance with the guidelines issued by RBI on the CSGL accounts.
PDs who act as custodians (i.e. CSGL account holders) and offer the facility of maintaining gilt accounts to their constituents, should not permit settlement of any sale transaction by their constituents unless the security sold is actually held in the gilt account of the constituent.
Indirect access to NDS-OM has been permitted to certain segments of investors through banks and PDs vide
circular IDMD.DOD.No.5893/10.25.66/2007-08 dated May 27, 2008
. PDs should adhere to the guidelines on maintenance of gilt accounts and investments on behalf of gilt account holders while undertaking 'constituent deals' on NDS-OM.
6.5 Failure to complete delivery of security/funds in an SGL transaction
Any default in delivery of security/funds in an SGL sale /purchase transaction undertaken by a PD will be viewed seriously. A report on such transaction, even if completed through the securities/funds shortage handling procedure of CCIL, must be submitted to the IDMD, RBI immediately. In terms of
circular RBI/2010-11/115- IDMD.DOD.17/11.01.01(B)/2010-11 dated July 14, 2010
, for any default in delivery of security / funds in a SGL sale / purchase transaction undertaken by a PD (event of bouncing of SGL transfer forms) and the failure of the PD to offer satisfactory explanation for such bouncing of SGL, the PD shall be liable to pay penalties as per the circular ibid.
7. Violation/Circumvention of Instructions
Any violation/circumvention of the above guidelines or the terms and conditions of the undertaking executed by a PD with RBI (
Annex I
) would be viewed seriously and such violation would attract penal action including the withdrawal of liquidity support, denial of access to the money market, withdrawal of authorization for carrying on the business as a PD, and/or imposition of monetary penalty or liquidated damages, as the RBI may deem fit.
8. Disclosure of Penal Actions
8.1 In order to maintain transparency with regard to imposition of penalties and in conformity with the best practices on disclosure of penalties imposed by the regulator, the details of the penalty levied on a PD shall be placed in the public domain.
8.2 The mode of disclosures of penalties, imposed by RBI will be as follows:
A Press Release will be issued by the RBI, giving details of the circumstances under which the penalty is imposed on the PD along with the communication on the imposition of penalty in public domain.
The penalty shall also be disclosed in the 'Notes on Accounts' to the Balance Sheet of the PD in its next Annual Report.
9. Exit/Termination procedure:
9.1 RBI may suspend or terminate a PD, as it may deem fit, in the following circumstances:
Violation/circumvention of the regulatory guidelines or the terms and conditions of the undertaking executed by a PD with the RBI.
Failure to meet the performance criteria and capital standards on an ongoing basis.
Repeatedly providing bids and offers in the primary and/or secondary market that are not reasonably competitive.
RBI is of the view that the PD has attempted to manipulate the market; involved in market abuse; made an incorrect representation or certification; failed to provide information required under the extant guidelines, or provided information that was incorrect, inaccurate, or incomplete.
If it appears, in the Reserve Bank’s judgment that the PD has an inadequate or weak control environment.
If a PD becomes the subject of, or involved with, regulatory or legal proceedings that, in the judgment of the Reserve Bank, unfavorably impacts the PD business.
PD intends to surrender PD authorisation on its own. In such a case, the PD should discuss the orderly unwinding of any positions held, agree the timing and date of termination of PD operations, and the content of any announcements to be made to the market, by the Reserve Bank. In the interests of discouraging ‘fair-weather’ trading and ensure that a PD is available in the market even when the market condition is not favourable, the Reserve Bank will not approve an application from the same firm for a fresh PD authorisation for some considerable period of time.
9.2 RBI will notify the PD of its intention to impose a sanction, and will provide the PD with an opportunity to submit its view, before taking a final decision.
9.3 RBI will ensure that a PD’s exit is carried out in a way that does not cause undue disruptions to other market participants.
9.4 Such suspension or termination will be made public by RBI through press release. An announcement in this regard shall be made preferably on the last working day of the week, with the sanction effective from the close of business on the same day.

3. Applicability of guidelines issued for PDs

Furthermore, the bank-PDs' role and obligations in terms of supporting the primary market auctions for issue of dated G-Sec and T-Bills/CMBs, underwriting of dated G-Sec, market-making in G-Sec and secondary market turnover in G-Sec will also be at par with those applicable to standalone PDs as enumerated in Section - I of this Master Circular.

3.5 The guidelines issued vide
