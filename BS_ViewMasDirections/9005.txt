Financial Regulation of Systemically Important NBFCs and Banks’  Relationship with them
The Reserve Bank of India had set up an Internal Group to examine  the issues relating to level playing field, regulatory convergence and  regulatory arbitrage in the financial sector.  Based on the recommendations of the Internal Group and on the basis of  the feedback received, final guidelines were issued for implementation on  December 12, 2006.
1
Modifications to the  Regulatory Framework
In the light of the concerns that arise out of the divergent  regulatory requirements for various aspects of functioning of banks and NBFCs  and keeping in view the broad principles for the proposed revision, the  following modifications were made in the regulatory framework for NBFCs.
A.
Regulatory Framework for Systemically  Important NBFCs–ND (NBFCs– ND–SI)
(i)
Determination of NBFC – ND – SI
All NBFCs – ND with an asset size of Rs. 100  crore and more as per the last audited balance sheet will be considered as a  systemically important NBFC
–
ND (NBFC-ND-SI).
(ii)
Capital Adequacy Ratio for NBFCs – ND –  SI
NBFCs – ND – SI shall maintain a minimum  Capital to Risk-weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) of 10% which was changed to
2
12%  as on March 31, 2010 and 15% as on March 31, 2011.
(iii)
Single / Group Exposure norms for NBFCs –  ND – SI
Exposure  norms were laid down for NBFCs-ND-SI.
Further, the NBFCs – ND – SI were advised to have a policy in  respect of exposures to a single entity / group. NBFCs-ND-SI not accessing public funds both  directly and indirectly can apply to the Reserve Bank for an appropriate  dispensation consistent with the spirit of the exposure limits.
B.
Additional Single  Exposure norms for Asset Finance Companies
(iv) In terms of
circular  DNBS.PD.CC.No.85/03.02.089/2006-2007 dated  December 6, 2006
,  companies financing real/physical assets for productive /economic activity will  be classified as Asset Finance Companies (AFCs) as per the criteria prescribed  therein.
In addition to the single party and single  group of parties exposure norms prescribed for NBFCs-D and NBFCs-ND-SI, AFCs  are permitted to exceed the exposure to a single party and single group of  parties up to a further 5 percent of their owned fund in exceptional  circumstances with the approval of their Boards.
C.
Expansion of  activities of NBFCs through automatic route
(v) NBFCs set up under the automatic route will  be permitted to undertake only those 18 activities
3
which are permitted under the automatic route. Diversification into any other  activity would require the prior approval of FIPB. Similarly a company which  has entered into an area permitted under the FDI policy (such as software) and  seeks to diversify into NBFC sector subsequently would also have to ensure  compliance with the minimum capitalization norms and other regulations as  applicable.
D.
Effective date and transition
Taking into account the likelihood that some of the NBFCs may not  be in compliance with some of the elements of the revised regulatory framework  a transition period up to end March 2007 was provided. Accordingly, NBFCs had  to comply with all elements of the revised framework with effect from April 1,  2007. In case any NBFC – ND – SI needed  more time for compliance, it had to apply to DNBS before the close of business  on January 31, 2007 clearly indicating the reasons for which it is not able to  ensure compliance within the above period and the time frame within which it  would be able to comply with all the relevant elements.
E.
Scope of application to certain categories
The guidelines contained in this circular are applicable to the  NBFCs as specified in the relevant paragraphs except the categories mentioned  below:
i). The Residuary Non  Banking Companies (RNBCs) and Primary Dealers (PDs) as they are subjected to a  separate set of regulations.
ii). Government owned  companies, as defined under Section 617 of the Companies Act, which are  registered with the Reserve Bank of India as NBFCs, are exempted from certain  provisions of Non-Banking Financial Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank)  Directions, 1998, at present. It is proposed to bring all deposit taking and  systemically important government owned companies under the provisions of the  said Directions which will be in conformity with the existing guidelines,  including those contained in this circular. However, the date from which they  are to fully comply with the regulatory framework will be decided later. These  companies, were therefore, required to prepare a roadmap for compliance with  the various elements of the NBFC regulations, in consultation with the  Government, and submit the same to the Reserve Bank (Department of Non Banking  Supervision – (DNBS)), by March 31, 2007

2.
Supervisory Framework for NBFC-ND-SI
5
To ensure adherence to  compliance with the regulatory framework for  NBFCs – ND – SI, such companies were advised to put in place a system  for submission of an annual statement of capital  funds, risk asset ratio etc., as at end of March every year in form NBS-7 as  per prescribed format. The first such  return was to be submitted for the year ending March 31, 2007. The return shall  be submitted within a period of three months from the close of the financial  year, every year. Such returns are to be submitted electronically and for the purpose, an NBFC-ND-SI  has to approach the Information Division of Central Office of this Department  for assignment of user-id and password for web-enabled submission of the return  . A hard copy of the return duly signed by the designated authority may be  filed with the Regional Office of the Department of Non-Banking Supervision in  whose jurisdiction the company is registered.
3.
Guidelines for NBFC-ND-SI as regards capital adequacy, liquidity  and disclosure norms
6
On a review of the  experience with the regulatory framework since April 2007, it was felt  desirable to enhance the capital adequacy requirement and put in place  guidelines for liquidity management and reporting, as also norms for  disclosures. Accordingly, the Bank placed on its web-site on June 2, 2008, the  draft guidelines for NBFCs-ND-SI as regards the above aspects for receiving the  comments of the public. These guidelines were finalized and Non-Banking  Financial (Non- Deposit Accepting or Holding) Companies Prudential Norms  (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2007 were amended.
(i)
Capital adequacy
7
The Capital adequacy  for NBFC-ND-SI was enhanced to 12% as on March 31, 2010 and 15% as on  March 31, 2011.
(ii)
Disclosure in the Balance Sheet
The disclosure norms in respect of NBFCs-ND-SI had been reviewed  and they should make additional disclosures in their Balance Sheet from the  year ending March 31, 2009 relating to:
Capital to Risk Assets  Ratio (CRAR)
Exposure to  real estate sector, both direct and indirect; and
Maturity pattern of assets  and liabilities
The format of disclosure of this additional information is  furnished in Company
Circular  DNBS (PD). CC. No. 125/03.05.002/2008-2009 dated August 1,   2008
4.
Asset Liability Management (ALM) – Reporting
NBFCs-ND-SI are required to submit three ALM returns i.e. ALM 1, ALM-2  and ALM-The periodicity of the Statement of short term dynamic liquidity  [NBS-ALM1] shall be monthly and that of Statement of structural liquidity  [NBS-ALM2] half-yearly. The frequency of Statement of Interest Rate Sensitivity  [NBS-ALM3] would be half yearly.
8
The  format of the ALM Returns (I, II and III) are available on the Bank's following  website (
https://cosmos.rbi.org.in
).
5.
Enhancement of NBFCs’ capital raising option for capital adequacy  purposes
Taking into consideration, the need for enhanced funds for  increasing business and meeting regulatory requirements, NBFCs-ND-SI are  permitted to augment their capital funds by issue of Perpetual Debt Instruments  (PDI) in accordance with the guidelines contained in the
circular  DNBS (PD) CC. No.131 /03.05.002 / 2008-2009 dated  October 29, 2008
. Such PDI shall be eligible for inclusion as Tier I Capital  to the extent of 15% of total Tier I capital as on March 31 of the previous  accounting year.

Ratings of NBFCs
NBFCs also issue financial products like Commercial Paper,  Debentures etc. to which rating is assigned by rating agencies. The ratings  assigned to such products may undergo changes for various reasons ascribed to  by the rating agencies. All NBFCs (both deposit taking and non-deposit taking)  with asset size of Rs 100 crore and above shall furnish the information about  downgrading / upgrading of assigned rating of any financial product issued by  them, within fifteen days of such a change in rating, to the Regional Office of  the Bank under whose jurisdiction their registered office is functioning.
7.
10
Criteria for deciding NBFC-ND-SI status
A non-deposit taking NBFC with an asset size of less than Rs. 100  crore as on balance sheet date might subsequently add on assets before the next  balance sheet date due to several reasons including business expansion plan. It  is clarified that once an NBFC reaches an asset size of Rs. 100 crore or above,  it shall come under the regulatory requirement for NBFCs-ND-SI as stated above,  despite not having such assets as on the date of last balance sheet.  Therefore, it is advised that all such  non-deposit taking NBFCs may comply with RBI regulations issued to NBFC-ND-SI  from time to time, as and when they attain an  asset size of Rs. 100 crore, irrespective of the date on which such size  is attained.
It is further observed that in a dynamic environment, the asset  size of a company can fall below Rs 100 crore in a given month, which may be  due to temporary fluctuations and not due to actual downsizing. It is clarified  that in such a case the company may continue to submit the monthly return on  Important Financial Parameters to Reserve Bank of India and to comply with the  extant directions as applicable to NBFC-ND-SI, till the submission of their  next audited balance sheet to Reserve Bank of India and a specific dispensation  is received from the Bank in this regard.
