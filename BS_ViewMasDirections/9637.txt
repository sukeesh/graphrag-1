Dear Sir,
Provisioning pertaining to Fraud Accounts
Please refer to the  guidelines compiled in
paragraph 4.2.9
of Master Circular on Prudential Norms  on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to  Advances dated July 1, 2014, in terms of which, in accounts where there are  potential threats for recovery on account of erosion in the value of security  or non­-availability of security and existence of other factors such as frauds  committed by borrowers, the asset classification, and consequent provisioning,  depends upon the realisable value of security.
2. On a review, it has been  decided to prescribe a uniform provisioning norm in respect of all cases of fraud,  as under:
The  entire amount due to the bank (irrespective of the quantum of security held  against such assets), or for which the bank is liable (including in case of  deposit accounts), is to be provided for over a period not exceeding four  quarters commencing with the quarter in which the fraud has been detected;
However, where there has been delay, beyond the  prescribed period, in reporting the fraud to the Reserve Bank, the entire  provisioning is required to be made at once. In addition, Reserve Bank of India  may also initiate appropriate supervisory action where there has been a delay by  the bank in reporting a fraud, or provisioning thereagainst.
3. We reiterate that banks must  scrupulously adhere to the guidelines contained in
circular  DBS.CO.CFMC.BC.No.1/23.04.001/2014-15 dated July 1, 2014
on ‘Frauds –  Classification and Reporting’.
Yours faithfully,
