Dear Sir,
Flexible Structuring of Existing Long Term Project Loans to
Infrastructure and Core Industries
Please refer to our
circular  DBOD.No.BP.BC.24/21.04.132/2014-15  dated July 15, 2014
on Flexible Structuring  of Long Term Project Loans to Infrastructure and Core Industries.
2. In terms of paragraph 9 of the said circular,  flexible structuring of project loans with the option of periodic refinancing will  be available only to new loans to infrastructure projects and core industries  projects sanctioned after the date of the circular.
3. In this connection, banks have represented  that such flexible structuring of project loans with the option of periodic  refinancing may also be allowed to existing loans to infrastructure projects  and core industries projects, as it would  ensure long term viability of existing infrastructure/core industries sector  projects by aligning the debt repayment obligations with cash flows generated  during their economic life.
4. The  issues have been examined by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Accordingly, it  has been decided to allow the banks to flexibly structure the existing project  loans to infrastructure projects and core industries  projects with the option to periodically refinance the same as per the norms  given below:
i) Only term loans to projects,  in which the aggregate exposure of all institutional lenders exceeds Rs.500  crore, in the infrastructure sector (as defined under the Harmonised Master  List of Infrastructure of RBI) and in the core industries sector (included in  the Index of Eight Core Industries (base: 2004-05) published by the Ministry of  Commerce and Industry, Government of India) will qualify for such flexible  structuring and refinancing;
ii) Banks may fix a Fresh Loan  Amortisation Schedule for the
existing project loans
once during the life  time of the project,
after
the date of commencement of commercial  operations (DCCO), based on the reassessment of the project cash flows, without  this being treated as ‘restructuring’ provided:
The loan is  a standard loan as on the date of change of loan amortisation schedule;
Net present  value of the loan remains same before and after the change in loan amortisation  schedule;
The Fresh Loan  Amortisation Schedule should be within 85 per cent (leaving a tail of 15 per  cent) of the initial concession period in case of infrastructure projects under  public private partnership (PPP) model; or 85 per cent of the initial economic  life envisaged at the time of project appraisal for determining the user  charges / tariff in case of non-PPP infrastructure projects; or 85 per cent of  the initial economic life envisaged at the time of project appraisal by Lenders  Independent Engineer in the case of other core industries projects; and
The viability of the project is reassessed by  the bank and vetted by the Independent Evaluation Committee constituted under  the aegis of the Framework for Revitalising Distressed Assets in the Economy  dated January 30, 2014 and communicated to the banks by Indian Banks  Association vide its circular No. C&I/CIR/2013-14/9307 dated April 29, 2014.
iii) If a project loan is  classified as ‘restructured standard’ asset as on the date of fixing the Fresh Loan  Amortisation Schedule as per para 4 (ii) above, while the current exercise of  fixing the Fresh Loan Amortisation Schedule may not be treated as an event of ‘repeated  restructuring’, the loan should continue to be classified as ‘restructured  standard’ asset. Upgradation of such assets would be governed by the extant prudential guidelines on restructuring of accounts taking  into account the Fresh Loan Amortisation Schedule;
iv) Any subsequent changes to  the above mentioned Fresh Loan Amortisation Schedule will be governed by the extant  restructuring norms;
v) Banks may refinance the  project term loan periodically (say 5 to 7 years) after the project has  commenced commercial operations. The repayment(s) at the end of each  refinancing period (equal in value to the remaining residual payments  corresponding to the Fresh Loan Amortisation Schedule) could be structured as a  bullet repayment, with the intent specified up front that it will be  refinanced. The refinance may be taken up by the same lender or a set of new lenders, or combination of both, or  by issue of corporate bond, as refinancing debt  facility, and such refinancing may repeat till the end of the Fresh Loan Amortisation  Schedule. The proviso regarding net present value as at paragraph 4(ii) would  not be applicable at the time of periodic refinancing of the project term loan;
vi) If the project term loan or  refinancing debt facility becomes a non-performing asset (NPA) at any stage,  further refinancing should stop and the bank which holds the loan when it  becomes NPA would be required to recognise the loan as such and make necessary  provisions as required under the extant regulations. Once the account comes out  of NPA status, it will be eligible for refinancing in terms of these  instructions;
vii) Banks may determine the  pricing of the loans at each stage of the project term loan or refinancing debt  facility, commensurate with the risk at each phase of the loan, and such  pricing should not be below the Base Rate of the bank;
viii) Banks should secure their  interest by way of proper documentation and security creation, etc.;
ix) Banks will be initially  allowed to count the cash flows from periodic amortisations of loans as also  the bullet repayment of the outstanding debt at the end of each refinancing  period for their asset-liability management; however, with experience gained,  banks will be required in due course to conduct behavioural studies of cash flows  in such amortisation of loans and plot them accordingly in ALM statements;
x) Banks should recognise from  a risk management perspective that there will be a probability that the loan  will not be refinanced by other banks, and should take this into account when  estimating liquidity needs as well as stress scenarios; and
xi) Banks should have a Board  approved policy for such financing.
5. It is clarified that  banks may also provide longer loan amortisation as per the above framework of  flexible structuring of project loans to existing project  loans to infrastructure and core industries projects which are classified as  ‘non-performing assets’. However, such an exercise would be treated as  ‘restructuring’ and the assets would continue to be treated as ‘non-performing  asset’. Such accounts may be upgraded only when all the outstanding  loan/facilities in the account perform satisfactorily during the ‘specified  period’ (as defined in the extant prudential guidelines on restructuring of  accounts), i.e. principal and interest on all facilities in the account are  serviced as per terms of payment during that period. However, periodic refinance facility would be  permitted only when the account is classified as ‘standard’ as prescribed in  the para 4 (vi) above.
6. It is reiterated  that the exercise of flexible structuring and refinancing should be carried out  only after DCCO. Further, our instructions on ‘take-out finance’ (circular  dated February 29, 2000), ‘transfer of borrowal accounts’ (
circular  dated May 10, 2012
), ‘refinancing of project loans by way of partial  takeover’ (
circulars  dated February 26, 2014
and
August  7, 2014
) and one of the conditions (
Para 15.2.2 (iii)
of Master Circular on  Prudential norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining  to Advances dated July 1, 2014, viz., “The repayment period of the restructured  advance including the moratorium, if any, does not exceed 15 years in the case  of infrastructure advances and 10 years in the case of other advances”)  for availing special asset class benefits  under restructuring guidelines will cease to be applicable on any loan to  infrastructure and core industries projects covered under the ambit of this circular.
7. RBI will review these instructions at  periodic intervals.
Yours faithfully,
(Sudarshan Sen)
