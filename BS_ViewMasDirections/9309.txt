The Chief Executive Officer
All  Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks
Madam/Dear Sir,
Names as Appearing in the Certificate of Registration  and the Licence -
Use of - Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks  (UCBs)
Please refer to our  circular UBD.No.BR/11/16.51.00/98-99 dated December 11, 1998 and subsequent
circulars  UBD.CO.BR.No.538/16.51.00/2000-01 dated May 21, 2001
and
UBD(PCB).Cir.34/16.51.00/2004-05  dated January 10, 2005
on the above subject advising UCBs to display  only their full name in the form in which it appears in the Certificate of  Registration issued by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies (RCS) and the  licence granted by Reserve Bank of India. The above instructions were issued  under Section 35 A of the Banking Regulation Act,1949(AACS).
2. Pursuant to the deliberations in the Standing Advisory Committee meeting held  in February 2006, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decided to allow UCBs to use  abbreviations/abridged names/logo etc., as part of their brand building effort  so long as the full name as appearing in the banking licence is also shown  along with such abbreviated/abridged names in all publicity  material/stationery. However, it has come to the notice of RBI that some UCBs  are not following this principle strictly by either not ensuring that their  full name appears alongside their abridged/abbreviated name or using too small  fonts for their full name which renders it unreadable. With a view to ensuring  that the efforts towards brand building do not compromise with the larger issue  of proper disclosure to the public, UCBs are advised to ensure that wherever  abbreviated/abridged version of their name is used for Logo/brand building, the  full name of the bank as appearing in the Certificate of Registration and the licence  granted by RBI should also be displayed prominently. Besides, the font size  used for the full name shall not be smaller than the one used for their  abbreviated name/abridged name/Logo.
3. These instructions are issued under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act,  1949 (AACS) and any contravention of or non-compliance to the same will attract  penalties under the relevant provisions of the Act.
Yours faithfully
(A.K.Bera)
Principal Chief General Manager
