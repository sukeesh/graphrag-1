Dear Sir,
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for putting indelible ink on the finger of the customers coming to a bank branch for SBNs
Please refer to our
Circular No. DCM (Plg) No.1226/10.27.00/2016-17 dated November 08, 2016
on the captioned subject. Based on feedback received from various quarters, it is felt that there is a need to put in place a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for such exchange of Specified Bank Notes (SBNs). Accordingly, banks are advised to put in place the following measures:
While exchanging the SBNs, the concerned bank branch and post offices would put indelible ink mark on the right index finger of the customer so as to identify that he/she has exchanged the old currency notes only once.
The indelible ink would be supplied to the bank/post offices by Indian banks Association (IBA) in coordination with the banks and consultation with RBI.
This procedure would be introduced to begin with in the metro cities and extended to other areas later.
Each bank branch will be provided with black indelible ink bottles of 5 ml each. The cap of the bottle includes a small brush for applying the ink.
The indelible ink can be applied by the cashier or any other official designated by the bank before the notes are given to the customer so that while the exchange of notes is taking place, a few seconds elapse which will allow the ink to dry up and prevent removal of ink.
Indelible ink on the index finger of the left hand or any other finger of the left hand may
not
be used as a pretext to deny exchange of old notes.
Yours faithfully,
(P Vijaya Kumar)
Chief General Manager
