All Non-Banking Financial Companies
Dear Sirs,
Appointment of Non-Deposit Accepting NBFCs with asset size of Rs.100 crore
and above as sub- agents under Money Transfer Service Schemes (MTSS)
Please refer to
circular DNBS.CC.PD.No.405/03.10.01/2014-15Â dated August 12, 2014
on the captioned subject. The circular has been reviewed in the light of certain representations received by the Reserve Bank, and it has been decided, in supersession of the existing instructions, to allow all non-deposit taking NBFCs to act as sub-agents under MTSS without any prior approval of RBI. Deposit accepting NBFCs are however, not permitted to undertake such activity.
Yours faithfully
(C.D. Srinivasan)
Chief General Manager
