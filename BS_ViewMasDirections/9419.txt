Madam/Sir,
F-TRAC – Counterparty Confirmation
A reference is invited to RBI
circular IDMD.PCD. 13 /14.01.02/2013-14 dated June 25, 2014
regarding  reporting of OTC trades in Commercial Papers (CPs) and Certificate of Deposits  (CDs); and OTC repo trades in corporate debt securities, CPs, CDs and  non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of original maturity less than one year on  F-TRAC - the reporting platform of Clearcorp Dealing Systems (India) Ltd.  (CDSIL).
2. As per extant guidelines, the  above-mentioned trades have to be physically confirmed by the back offices of  the counterparties. In F-TRAC, both the counterparties individually report  their respective sides of the trades and the trades are validated for trade  details before matching by F-TRAC. This ensures implicit confirmation by both  counterparties. Further, the details of the transactions are available on the  F-TRAC system.
3. On a  review, it has been decided to waive the requirement of exchange of physical  confirmation of trades matched on F- TRAC subject to the following conditions:
Participants  entering into one time bilateral agreement for  eliminating the exchange of confirmation;
Participants adhering to the extant laws such as stamp duty as  may be applicable; and
Participants  ensuring adherence to a sound risk management framework and complying with all  the regulatory and legal requirements and practices, in this regard.
4. The dispensation with  respect to waiver of physical confirmation will be subject to review in case of  any change in ownership of the F-TRAC platform or reporting arrangements  thereof.
Yours faithfully
(Dimple Bhandia)
General Manager-in-Charge
