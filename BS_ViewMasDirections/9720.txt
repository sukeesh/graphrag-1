(the Directions) prescribing detailed guidelines on the regulatory framework for NBFCs to sponsor IDFs which are to be set up as NBFCs.
2. On a review in consultation with the Government of India, it has been decided to amend the Directions so as to allow entry of IDF-NBFCs into sectors where there is no presence of a Project Authority. Accordingly, the Directions have been amended as given in the subsequent paragraphs:
3. Investments
3.1 In terms of para 7 of the Directions, IDF-NBFCs shall invest only in PPP and post commercial operations date (COD) infrastructure projects which have completed at least one year of satisfactory commercial operation and are a party to a Tripartite Agreement with the Concessionaire and the Project Authority for ensuring a compulsory buyout with termination payment.
3.2 In addition to the above, it has been decided to allow IDF-NBFCs to undertake investments in non-PPP projects and PPP projects without a Project Authority, in sectors where there is no Project Authority, provided these are post COD infrastructure projects which have completed at least one year of satisfactory commercial operation.
4. Risk Weights for the Purpose of Capital Adequacy
4.1 As per the extant instructions, for the purpose of computing capital adequacy, bonds of IDF-NBFCs and all assets of Infrastructure Finance Companies (IFCs), covering PPP and post COD projects in existence over a year of commercial operation shall be assigned a risk weight of 50 per cent.
4.2 To bring in uniformity, it has been decided to extend the same to all NBFCs i.e. all assets, including bonds and loans, covering PPP and post COD infrastructure projects in existence over a year of commercial operation shall be assigned a risk weight of 50 per cent.
4.3 Investments in non-PPP projects shall be risk weighted as per the extant regulations as given in the Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial (Non-Deposit Accepting or Holding) Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2015.
5. Credit Concentration Norms
5.1 In terms of para 8 of the Directions, the maximum exposure that an IDF-NBFC can take on individual projects will be at 50 per cent of its total Capital Funds. An additional exposure up to 10 per cent could be taken at the discretion of the Board of the IDF-NBFC. RBI may, upon receipt of an application from an IDF-NBFC and on being satisfied that the financial position of the IDF-NBFC is satisfactory, permit additional exposure up to 15 per cent (over 60 per cent) subject to such conditions as it may deem fit to impose regarding additional prudential safeguards.
5.2 The directions of para 8 shall continue to be in force for all assets covering PPP and post COD infrastructure projects in existence over a year of commercial operation and party to a Tripartite Agreement with the Concessionaire and the Project Authority for ensuring a compulsory buyout with termination payment. However, investment in non-PPP projects and PPP projects without a project authority, in sectors where there is no Project Authority, shall be governed by the credit concentration norms as applicable to Infrastructure Finance Companies as defined in Systemically Important Non-Banking Financial (Non-Deposit Accepting or Holding) Companies Prudential Norms (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2015.
