Dear Sir/Madam,
Section 42(1) of the  Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934, Section 24 of Banking Regulation Act 1949 and  Section 18 and  24 of the Banking  Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) – FCNR(B)/NRE deposits – Exemption from maintenance  of CRR/SLR and Exclusion from Outstanding Advances for Priority Sector Lending  for RRBs
Please refer to our
circular  RPCD.CO.RRB/RCB.BC.No.20/03.05.33/2013-14  dated August 19, 2013
, on the captioned subject, wherein banks were  advised that with effect from fortnight beginning August 24, 2013, incremental  FCNR (B) deposits as also NRE deposits with reference base date of July 26,  2013, and having maturity of three years and above, mobilised by them will be  exempt from maintenance of CRR and SLR. Further, advances extended against such  incremental FCNR(B)/NRE deposits qualifying for exemption from CRR/SLR  requirements will also be excluded from Outstanding Advances for computation of  priority sector lending targets for Regional Rural Banks.
2. On a review, and in order to give banks some  time, it has been decided that the exemption granted on incremental FCNR  (B)/NRE deposits from maintenance of CRR/SLR will be withdrawn with effect from  reporting fortnight beginning March 8, 2014, i.e., only the eligible amount of  incremental FCNR (B) and NRE deposits of maturities of three years and above  from the base date of July 26, 2013, and outstanding as on March 7, 2014, would  qualify for CRR/SLR exemption till their maturities/ pre-mature withdrawals.
3. Further, advances extended against the above  mentioned   incremental  FCNR(B)/NRE deposits, qualifying for exemption  from CRR/SLR requirements, will be eligible for   exclusion  from Outstanding  Advances, till their repayment, for computation of priority sector lending  targets for Regional Rural Banks.
4. Please acknowledge receipt to our Regional  Office concerned.
Yours faithfully,
