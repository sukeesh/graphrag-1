All Non Banking Financial Companies
Dear Sir,
Online Returns to be submitted by NBFCs- Revised
Please refer to our
Master Circular no DNBS.IT.CC.No.01/24.01.191/2015-16 dated July 01, 2015
on Returns to be submitted by NBFCs.
2. It has been decided to rationalize the returnsâ€™ to be submitted online through COSMOS as below:
Change in periodicity of NDSI-500cr and ALM-1 returns from monthly to quarterly
Discontinuation of NBS- 6 return as the same information is received through NBS-1 return.
3. We also notice that some of the NBFCs are not submitting correct branch information return as per our guidelines
DNBS (PD).CC.No.355/03.02.02/2013-14 dated September 3, 2013
. To maintain uniformity and avoid misunderstanding, it has been decided that the concerned NBFCs should report the stock data of branches as at end of every quarter rather than providing incremental number of branches during the quarter.
4. The revised list of the returns to submitted by the NBFC is given in
Annex
.
Yours faithfully,
(Dr. Sathyan David)
Chief General Manager
