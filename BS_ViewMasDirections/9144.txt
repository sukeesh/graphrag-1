In pursuance of the Hon’ble Supreme Court Judgment  dated July 4, 2011, Government of India has constituted a Special Investigation  Team (SIT) under the Chairmanship of Hon’ble Justice M.B. Shah. In this regard,  the Hon’ble Supreme Court had directed that:
“All organs agencies, departments and agents of the State, whether at the level  of the Union of India, or the State  Government, including but not limited to all statutorily formed individual  bodies, and other constitutional bodies extend all the cooperation necessary  for the functioning of the Special Investigation Team.
The Union of India and where needed the State Government will facilitate  the conduct of the investigations, in their fullest measures, by the Special Investigation  Team and functioning, by extending all necessary financial, material, legal,  diplomatic and intelligence resources, whether such investigations or portions  of such investigations occur inside the country or abroad.”

Yours  faithfully,
