Dear Sir
Financial Literacy activities conducted by Financial Literacy Centres and rural branches of banks – monitoring system
Please refer to our
circulars RPCD.FLC.No.12452/12.01.018/2011-12 dated June 6, 2012
and
RPCD.FLC.No.7641/12.01.018/ 2012-13 dated January 31, 2013
issuing operational guidelines for conduct of financial literacy camps by FLCs and rural branches of banks.
2. We have been reviewing the financial literacy activities undertaken by Financial Literacy Centres (FLCs) for last two years on the basis of a quarterly report received through SLBC of the respective states and it is observed that FLCs have achieved considerable progress in creating awareness and linking the excluded segment to the banking system. Since rural branches of banks are also mandated to conduct a minimum of one financial literacy camp in a month, it has been decided to monitor their activities also on quarterly basis as per reporting format given in
Annex II
.
3. Since the literacy camps are being conducted for last two years, it is time now to measure the extent of financial inclusion achieved through these camps. For the purpose, the existing quarterly report on financial literacy activities conducted by FLCs has been modified as given in
Annex I
.
4. As hitherto, SLBC/UTLBCs are advised to submit the above mentioned quarterly reports in the prescribed formats given in
Annex I
and
Annex II
, to the respective Regional Offices of RBI within 20 days after the end of each quarter. The reports for the quarter ended June 2014 may be submitted to our Regional Office on or before August 14, 2014.
Yours faithfully
(A Udgata)
