1. General
1.1 As a  prudential measure aimed at better risk management and avoidance of  concentration of credit risk, the primary (urban) co-operative banks have been  advised to fix limits on their exposure -
to individual borrowers and group borrowers,
to specific sectors, and
towards unsecured advances and unsecured  guarantees
1.2 In  addition, these banks are also required to observe certain statutory and  regulatory restrictions in respect of:
advances against shares, debentures and  bonds
investments in shares,  debentures and bonds
1.3 Currently operative instructions on all these aspects are detailed in the  following paragraphs.
2. Exposure Norms
2.1 Exposure  Ceiling to Individual / Group Borrowers
2.1.1 Primary  (urban) co-operative banks are required to fix, with the approval of their  Board of Directors, exposure ceiling in relation to
bank's capital funds
. The exposure for the purpose shall comprise  both credit exposure (loans and advances) and investment exposure (Non SLR) as  detailed at para 2.2.2(B) so that -
the  exposure to an individual borrower does not exceed 15 per cent of capital  funds, and
the exposure to a group  of borrowers does not exceed 40 per cent of capital funds.
2.1.2 The  exercise of computing the exposure ceilings may be conducted every year after  the finalisation and audit of balance sheet of the bank and the exposure  ceilings may be advised to the loan sanctioning authorities and the investment  department in the bank.
In view of the linking of  shareholding to lending, accretion to or reduction in the share capital after  the balance sheet date, may be taken into account for determining exposure  ceiling at half-yearly intervals, with the approval of their Board of  Directors. Accordingly banks may, if they so desire, fix a fresh exposure limit  taking into account the amount of share capital available as on 30th September.  However, accretion to capital funds other than to share capital, such as  half-yearly profit etc., will not be eligible for reckoning the exposure  ceiling. Banks should also ensure that they do not take exposures in excess of  ceiling prescribed in anticipation of infusion of capital on a future date.
2.2 Definitions
2.2.1
Capital  Funds
The "Capital  Funds" for the purpose of exposure norm would comprise both Tier I and  Tier II Capital as defined in our Master Circular on Capital Adequacy.
2.2.2 The Exposure shall include both credit  exposure (Loans and Advances) and investment exposure (non-SLR) as indicated  below:
2.2.2 (A)
Credit Exposure
Credit exposure
shall include
-
(a)
funded
and
non-funded
credit limits and
underwriting
and similar commitments,
(b) facilities extended by way of equipment leasing  and hire purchase financing, and
(c) ad hoc limits sanctioned to the borrowers to  meet the contingencies.
Credit exposure shall not include loans and  advances granted against the security of bank's own term deposits.
The sanctioned limit or outstanding  whichever is higher shall be reckoned for arriving at credit exposure limit.  Further, in case of fully drawn term loans, where there is no scope of  re-drawal of any portion of the sanctioned limit, banks may reckon the  outstanding for arriving at credit exposure limit.
In respect of non-funded credit limit, 100%  of such limit or outstanding, whichever is higher, need be taken into account  for the purpose.
Consortium  / Multiple Banking / Syndication
The level of individual bank's share shall be  governed by single borrower / group exposure.
2.2.2(B)
Investment  Exposure (Non SLR)
Banks are allowed to invest  in 'A' or equivalent and higher rated Commercial Papers (CPs), debentures, and  bonds that are redeemable in nature.

These securities will be classified as  non-SLR investments in the books of Multi State UCBs.
Group
2.2.3 The decision in regard to definition of a
group
is left to the perception of the  banks, which are generally aware of the basic constitution of their clientele.  The group to which a particular borrowing unit belongs may, therefore, be  decided by the banks on the basis of relevant information available with them,  the guiding principle in this regard being commonality of management and  effective control.
2.2.4 The different  firms with one or more common partners engaged in the same line of business,  viz. manufacturing, processing, trading activity, etc. shall be deemed to be  connected group and units coming under common ownership shall be deemed to be a  single party.

Exposure to Housing, Real  Estate and Commercial Real Estate
2.3 Primary (urban) co-operative banks are advised to frame, with  the approval of their Board of Directors, comprehensive prudential norms  relating to the ceiling on the total amount of real estate loans, keeping in  view the Reserve Bank of India guidelines to ensure that bank credit is used  for construction activity and not for activity connected with speculation in  real estate subject to the following:
2.3.1 The  exposure of UCBs to housing (including individual loans for house repairs,  additions and alteration), real estate and commercial real estate loans (including  Commercial Real Estate –Residential Housing) would be limited to 10 per cent of  their total assets. The above ceiling of 10 per cent of total assets can be  exceeded by an additional limit of 5 per cent of total assets for the purpose  of grant of housing loans to individuals for purchase or construction of  dwelling units costing up to
`
25  lakh.
2.3.2 Tier-I*  UCBs may grant housing loans up to a maximum of
`
30.00  lakh per beneficiary of a dwelling unit and Tier-II UCBs (all other UCBs which  are not Tier-I UCBs) may extend individual housing loans up to a maximum of
`
70.00 lakh per beneficiary of a dwelling unit subject  to extant prudential exposure limits
* Tier I UCBs are categorised as under:
- Banks having deposits  below
`
100 crore operating in a single district
- Banks with deposits below
`
100 crore operating in more than one district will be  treated as Tier I provided the branches are in contiguous districts and  deposits and advances of branches in one district separately constitute at  least 95% of the total deposits and advances respectively of the bank and
- Banks with deposits below
`
100 crore, whose branches were originally in a single  district but subsequently, became multi-district due to reorganization of the  district
Deposits and advances as referred to in the  above definition may be reckoned as on 31st March of the immediate preceding  financial year.
2.3.3  The total assets may be reckoned based on the audited balance sheet as on March  31 of the preceding financial year.  For reckoning total assets, losses, intangible assets, contra items like bills  receivables etc. would be excluded.
2.3.4 Working capital  loans given by UCBs against hypothecation of construction materials provided to  the contractors who undertake comparatively small construction on their own  without receiving advance payments is exempted from the prescribed limit.
2.3.5 UCBs  are not permitted to exceed the limit prescribed for grant of housing, real  estate, commercial real estate loans to the extent of funds obtained from  higher financing agencies and refinance from National Housing Bank.
2.4    Inter-bank  Exposure Limit
Prudential  Inter-bank (Gross) Exposure Limit
2.4.1 The total amount of  deposits placed by an UCB with other banks (inter-bank) for all purposes  including call money / notice money, and deposits, if any, placed for availing  clearing facility, CSGL facility, currency chest facility, remittance facility  and non-fund based facilities like Bank Guarantee (BG), Letter of Credit (LC),  etc shall not exceed 20% of its total deposit liabilities as on March 31 of the  previous year. The balances held in deposit accounts with commercial banks and  in permitted scheduled UCBs and investments in Certificate of Deposits issued  by commercial banks, being inter bank exposures, will be included in this 20%  limit.
Prudential  Inter-bank Counter Party Limit
2.4.2 Within the prudential inter-bank (gross)  exposure limit, deposits with any single bank should not exceed 5% of the  depositing bank's total deposit liabilities as on March 31 of the previous  year.
Exemptions from the  prudential limit
The balances maintained by  UCBs with the Central Cooperative Bank of the district concerned or with the  State Cooperative Bank of the State concerned under the provisions of Section  24 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS) are also exempted from the  prudential limit on inter-bank exposure limits [Paragraph 2.4.1 and 2.4.2].
2.4.3 Deposits placed by non-scheduled UCBs with  scheduled UCBs
2.4.3.1 Non-scheduled UCBs are permitted to place deposits with strong scheduled UCBs  complying with the following norms:
The bank complies with the prescribed level of CRAR.
Net NPA of the bank is less than 7%.
The bank has not defaulted in the  maintenance of CRR / SLR for the last two years
The bank has declared net profits for the last three consecutive  years
The bank complies with prudential norms on income recognition,  asset classification and provisioning, exposure ceilings and loans and advances  to directors.
The  amount of deposits placed by a non-scheduled UCB with any scheduled UCB should  not exceed 5% of the depositing bank's total deposit liabilities as on March 31  of the previous year.
2.4.3.2 Acceptance of deposits from non-scheduled UCBs by the scheduled UCBs will also  be subject to the following conditions:
The total inter-UCB deposits accepted by a scheduled UCB  should not exceed 10% of its deposit liabilities as on 31st March of the  previous financial year.
The rate of interest offered on such deposits should be  market related.
Scheduled  UCBs should not, however, place deposits with other scheduled / non-scheduled  UCBs.
2.5  Exposure in Non-SLR investment
Investments in non-SLR securities should be  limited to 10% of a bank's total deposits as on March 31 of the previous year.
Investments in unlisted securities should not  exceed 10% of the total non-SLR investments at any time. Where banks have  already exceeded the said limit, no incremental investment in such securities  will be permitted. Investment in Non-SLR debt securities (both primary and  secondary market) by UCBs where the security is proposed to be listed in the  Exchange(s) may be considered as investment in listed security at the time of  making investment. However, if such security is not listed within the period  specified, the same will be reckoned for the 10% limit specified for unlisted  Non-SLR securities. In case such investments included under unlisted Non-SLR  securities lead to breach of 10% limit, UCB would not be allowed to make fresh  investments in Non-SLR securities till its investment in unlisted securities is  brought within the limit of 10%.
All investments as above will be subject to  the prescribed prudential individual / group exposure limits.
All fresh investments under Non-SLR category  should be classified under Held for Trading (HFT) / Available for Sale (AFS)  categories only and marked to market. However, investment by UCBs in the long  term bonds issued by companies engaged in executing infrastructure projects and  having a minimum residual maturity of seven years may be classified under HTM  category.
The limits prescribed at a) and b) above for investment in  Non-SLR/ unlisted securities may be exceeded, if it becomes necessary to do so  for acquiring membership in Market Infrastructure Companies such as Clearing  Corporation of India Ltd., National Payment Corporation of India and Society  for World Wide Inter-Bank Financial Tele-Communication (SWIFT) etc.
Multi-State UCBs'  investments in debentures/ bonds/ Security Receipts (SRs) issued by Securitisation  Company/ Reconstruction Company (SC/RC) will constitute exposure on the SC/RC.  As there are a few SC/RC, MSUCBs' exposure on SC/RC through their investments  in debentures / bonds / SRs issued by the SC/RC may go beyond their prudential  exposure ceiling. In view of the extra ordinary nature of event, MSUCBs will be  allowed, in the initial years, to exceed prudential exposure ceiling on a  case-to-case basis
3. Ceiling on Unsecured Advances (with Surety & without Surety)

In order to promote lending to priority  sectors and to provide impetus to the objective of financial inclusion it has  been decided that UCBs fulfilling the following conditions may, with the prior  approval of the Reserve Bank, grant unsecured loans up to Rs 20,000/- in a  single account (with or without surety) up to 25% of their total assets:
The entire loan portfolio of the bank  should be covered under priority sector.
All the loans should be sanctioned as  small value loans ie up to
`
20,000/- in a single account.
The UCB should have assessed CRAR of  9%.

3.2.3 In view of the fact that salary  earners’ banks grant advances to salaried employees of a particular institution  / group of institutions to which their membership is restricted and deductions  are made from the salaries through their employers, the salary earners’ banks  may allow such advances in excess of the limits prescribed above subject to the  following conditions:
The Co-operative Societies Act of the State  concerned contains an obligatory provision for deduction of periodical loan  instalments by the employer out of employee's salaries / wages to meet bank's  claims.
The bank has taken advantage of this provision  in respect of each of such advance.
A general limit for such advances is fixed by the bank in terms of  certain multiples of the pay packet taking into account the monthly income of  the employees.
3.2.4 The advances granted by primary (urban)  co-operative banks, other than salary earners’ societies, to all salaried  borrowers wherein repayment is sought to be ensured through deduction from  borrower's salaries as per the provisions of the State Co-operative Societies  Act, should be reckoned as secured only for the purpose of computation of total  unsecured advances to the members as a whole.

5.7 Bank  Finance to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs)
5.7.1
Admission of NBFCs as Members
For  availing loans or advances from a primary (urban) co-operative bank, its  membership is a must. However, primary (urban) co-operative banks are normally  not expected to enroll non-banking financial institutions (like investment and  financial companies as well as other persons engaged in the business competing  with or conflicting with the business of the bank) as their members since it  would be in contravention of the state co-operative societies act concerned and  will also not be in conformity with the provision of model by-law No. 9.  Therefore,
banks should not finance  NBFCs, other than those engaged in hire- purchase / leasing
.
Similarly, admission of non-banking  financial companies which are
not  engaged exclusively
in leasing / hire purchase business as members may be  contrary to the provisions contained in the state co-operative societies act  concerned and model by-law No. 9. It will, therefore, be necessary for the  primary (urban) co-operative banks to obtain prior approval of the Registrar of  Co-operative Societies concerned before admitting such leasing / hire purchase  companies as members.
5.7.2  Activities
Eligible
for Finance to NBFCs engaged in Hire Purchase / Leasing Activities
Within the prescribed  credit exposure norms and above stated restrictions, primary (urban)  co-operative banks, with working capital funds aggregating to
`
25 crores and above, may finance the equipment  leasing / hire purchase companies, subject to the following limits:
Type of NBFC
Maximum Limit 
          on Bank Finance
(i)
Equipment    leasing and hire purchase companies* having not less than 75 percent of their    assets in equipment leasing and hire purchase, and 75 percent of their gross    income from these two types of activities as per the last audited balance    sheet of the companies.
3    times of the Net Owned Funds (NOF) of the NBFC
(ii)
Other    equipment and hire purchase companies
2    times of the Net Owned Funds (NOF) of the NBFC
* The equipment leasing and  hire purchase companies are now known as 'Asset Finance Companies'
Note
The maximum limit  on bank finance should be within the
overall  ceiling of borrowing by NBFCs, upto ten times of their NOF.
Bank finance to  leasing concerns should be restricted only to "full payout" leases  i.e. those leases where the cost of the asset is fully recovered during the  primary lease period itself and further it should cover purchases of only new  equipment.
As a prudent policy, lease rentals  due during the period of next five years should alone be taken into account for  the purpose of lending.
5.7.3
Activities not Eligible for Finance to NBFCs  engaged in Hire Purchase / Leasing Activities
(i) The  following activities undertaken by non-banking financial companies engaged in  hire purchase / leasing activities are not eligible for bank credit. As such,  these items should be excluded from the build-up of current assets while  arriving at permissible bank finance for all categories of NBFCs:
Bills discounted  / rediscounted by NBFCs, except where specifically permitted;
Investments made  in shares, debentures etc. of a current nature, i.e., stock-in-trade;
Investment in and  advances to subsidiaries, group companies or other entities; and
Investments in and inter-corporate  loans / deposits to other companies.
(ii) In respect of  items indicated at (a) and (b) above, banks should not make any adjustment in  the projected net working capital (NWC). It may be added that the projected NWC  represents long-term surplus available to support current operations and,  therefore, does not need to be adjusted as a result of changing / pruning the  level of current assets while reducing the level of maximum permissible bank  finance.
5.7.4
Financing of NBFCs by Scheduled Primary  (Urban) Cooperative Banks
The
Scheduled
primary (urban) co-operative  banks may rediscount bills discounted by NBFCs arising from sale of commercial  vehicles, including light commercial vehicles, two wheeler and three wheeler  vehicles, subject to normal lending safeguards and the following conditions:
(a) the bills should  have been drawn by the manufacturers on dealers only,
(b) the bills should  represent genuine sale transactions as may be ascertained from the chassis /  engine numbers, and
(c) before  rediscounting the bills, the scheduled primary (urban) co-operative banks  should satisfy themselves about the bona- fides and track record of NBFCs which  have discounted the bills.
The
Scheduled
primary (urban) co-operative banks  may provide finance to NBFCs eligible for bank finance for the purpose of  on-lending to Small Road and Water Transport Operators (SRWTOs) for purchase of  trucks and classify such advances under priority sector, provided the ultimate  borrowers (SRWTOs) satisfy the eligibility requirements for being classified  under the priority sector.
Scheduled
primary (urban) co-operative  banks may finance NBFCs for on-lending to individual farmers and for hire  purchase schemes for distribution of agricultural machinery and implements and  the same may be reckoned for the purpose of priority sector lending as indirect  finance to agriculture.
The Scheduled primary (urban) co-operative  banks may extend finance to NBFCs or other financial intermediaries for on-lending  to small and micro enterprises (manufacturing as well as service) and classify  such finance under priority sector after satisfying that relevant norms at the  ultimate borrowal level are complied with.
5.8 Financing  Equipment Leasing and Hire Purchase Financing
5.8.1 Consequent  to the Government of India notification dated 12 December 1995 specifying 'Hire  Purchase' and 'Equipment Leasing' as forms of business in which it is lawful  for a primary cooperative bank to engage, Scheduled urban cooperative banks are  allowed to undertake these activities.
Scheduled
urban cooperative banks are advised to ensure that:
These activities are undertaken only at select branches of banks
These  activities are to be treated at par with loans and advances and subject to  extant exposure norms on individual / group borrowers.
The  banks should maintain a balanced portfolio of equipment leasing, hire purchase  vis-a-vis aggregate credit. Credit exposure to each of these activities should  not exceed 5% of total advances.
The  banks undertaking these activities should follow prudent accounting standards.  Entire lease rental should not be taken to banks' income account. Only the  interest component should be taken to income account. The component representing  replacement cost of the asset should be carried to the Balance Sheet in the  form of a provision for depreciation
As a  prudent measure, full depreciation should be provided during the primary lease  period of the asset.
Leasing  and hire purchase financing extended by scheduled primary cooperative banks,  departmentally, may be classified as priority sector advances provided the  beneficiary satisfies the criteria laid down by RBI for treating such advances  as advances to priority sector.
Non Scheduled banks, which also desire to  undertake these activities should obtain RBI permission.
5.9 Financing  for Agricultural Activities
5.9.1 The primary (urban)  co-operative banks are permitted to finance agricultural activities under  priority sector subject to the following conditions:
UCBs  would provide direct finance only to members (no nominal members) and not  through any agency like primary agricultural credit societies and primary land  development banks etc.,
Credit should be extended only after obtaining 'no dues certificate' from the  existing credit agencies in the area, and
Banks should follow the  scales of finance and obtain security as per guideline issued by RBI / NABARD.
5.10  Loans  to Self Help Groups (SHGs) / Joint Liability Groups (JLGs)
5.10.1 UCBs may lend to  SHGs and JLGs as per their Board approved policy framed according to the prescribed  RBI guidelines in this regard.
5.10.2 UCBs may follow the  method of lending directly to SHGs / JLGs. Lending through intermediaries will  not be permitted.
5.10.3 The extant limits  (individual and total) on grant of unsecured loans and advances will not apply  to loans granted to SHGs. However, loans granted by UCBs to JLGs, to the extent  not backed by tangible security, will be treated as unsecured and will be  subject to the extant limits on unsecured loans and advances.
5.10.4 Loans granted to  SHGs / JLGs would be governed by the extant guidelines on individual exposure  limits.
5.10.5 The maximum amount of loan to SHGs should  not exceed four times of the savings of the group. The limit may be exceeded in  case of well managed SHGs subject to a ceiling of ten times of savings of the  group. The groups may be rated on the basis of certain objective parameters  such as proven track record, savings pattern, recovery rate, housekeeping etc.  JLGs are not obliged to keep deposits with the bank and hence the amount of  loan granted to JLGs would be based on the credit needs of the JLG and the  bank's assessment of the credit requirement.
5.11 Restriction  on Advances to Defaulters of Statutory Dues
5.11.1 Under the law,  employees' contributions to provident fund deducted from wages of the employees  / members, for a period of more than six months and not paid to the  Commissioner are a first charge on the assets of the borrowers, in the case of  the insolvency / winding up of the borrowing employer. In the circumstances,  primary (urban) co-operative banks should safeguard their interest vis-à-vis  such statutory dues.
5.11.2 Therefore, banks should satisfy  themselves that there are no arrears of Provident Fund and other statutory dues  of the borrowers by obtaining a declaration from them that all such dues have  been duly paid. Proof in this regard may be called for only in cases where banks  have reason to doubt the borrowers' declaration. Even where a proof is  required, it is not necessary to insist on a certificate from the Regional  Provident Fund Commissioner; production of a receipt evidencing the payment of  the dues or a certificate from the auditors of the borrower or any other  similar proof may be considered sufficient. In the case of sick units where  there are arrears for reasons beyond the control of the borrowers, banks may  continue to consider such cases on merits.
