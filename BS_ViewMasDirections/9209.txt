Madam/ Dear Sir,
Guidelines  for transfer of Assets and Liabilities of Urban Cooperative Banks to Commercial  Banks- Modification
Please refer to our
circular  UBD.BPD.(PCB).Cir.No.47/09.16.900/2009-10 dated February 24, 2010
on guidelines for  transfer of Assets and Liabilities of Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) to  Commercial Banks.
2. With a view to ensuring that the  process of consolidation by way of non-disruptive exit of weak entities by a  scheme of transfer of assets and liabilities of UCBs to commercial banks is  undertaken in a transparent manner without affecting the financial health of  the acquiring entities and the banking system as a whole, it has been decided  to modify the existing guidelines for transfer of assets and liabilities of  UCBs to commercial banks by stipulating the following conditions:
a) The acquiring bank should not  incur any loss arising out of the said merger/ transfer of assets and  liabilities.
b) Big depositors holding deposits in  excess of
`
1.00 lakh each will be required to  sacrifice in proportion to the deposit erosion of the target bank.
3. In view of this,  paragraphs 2.3 to 2.9 of
Annex I
to the circular dated February 24, 2010  regarding initial/ additional contribution to be made by the transferee bank  stand modified to that extent.
Yours faithfully,
(A K Bera)
Principal Chief General Manager
