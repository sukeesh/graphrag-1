I. Guidelines on Corporate  Governance
1
As it is evident, the need for good corporate  governance has been gaining increased emphasis over the years. Globally,  companies are adopting best corporate practices to increase the confidence of  investors as also that of other stakeholders. Corporate Governance is the key  to protecting the interests of the stake-holders. Its universal applicability  has no exception to the Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) which too are  essentially corporate entities. Listed NBFCs which are required to adhere to  listing agreement and rules framed by SEBI are already required to comply with SEBI  prescriptions on Corporate Governance. In order to enable NBFCs to adopt best  practices and greater transparency in their operations, following guidelines  are proposed for consideration of the Board of Directors of all Deposit taking  NBFCs with deposit size of Rs 20 crore and above and all non-deposit taking  NBFCs with asset size of Rs 100 crore and above (NBFCs-ND-SI).
1. Constitution of Audit  Committee
In terms of extant  instructions, an NBFC having assets of  Rs. 50 crore and above as per its last audited balance sheet is already  required to constitute an Audit  Committee, consisting of not less than three members of its Board of Directors.  These instructions shall remain valid. In addition, NBFCs-D with deposit size  of Rs 20 crore may also consider constituting an Audit Committee on similar  lines.
2. Constitution of Nomination  Committee
The importance of  appointment of directors with ‘fit and proper’ credentials is well recognised  in the financial sector. In terms of Section 45-IA (4) (c) of the RBI Act,  1934, while considering the application for grant of Certificate of  Registration to undertake the business of non-banking financial institution, it  is necessary to ensure that the general character of the management or the proposed  management of the non-banking financial company shall not be prejudicial to the  interest of its present and future depositors. In view of the interest evinced  by various entities in this segment, it would be desirable that NBFCs-D with  deposit size of Rs 20 crore and above and NBFCs-ND-SI may form a Nomination  Committee to ensure ‘fit and proper’ status of proposed/existing Directors.
3. Constitution of Risk  Management Committee
The market risk for NBFCs  with Public Deposit of Rs.20 crore and above or having an asset size of Rs.100  crore or above as on the date of last audited balance sheet is addressed by the  Asset Liability Management Committee (ALCO) constituted to monitor the asset  liability gap and strategize action to mitigate the risk associated. To manage  the integrated risk, a risk management committee may be formed, in addition to  the ALCO in case of the above category of NBFCs.
4. Disclosure and transparency
The following information  should be put up by the NBFC to the Board of Directors at regular intervals as  may be prescribed by the Board in this regard:
progress made in putting in place a progressive risk management  system, and risk management policy and strategy followed,
conformity with corporate governance standards  viz; in composition of various committees, their role and functions,  periodicity of the meetings and compliance with coverage and review functions,  etc.
5. Connected Lending
Applicability of the  paragraph 2(vi) of the circular dated May 8, 2007 containing instructions on  connected lending was kept in abeyance till a review as advised vide

NBFCs shall frame their internal guidelines on  corporate governance, enhancing the scope of the guidelines without sacrificing  the spirit underlying the above guidelines and it shall be published on the company’s  web-site, if any, for the information of various stakeholders.

Rotation of partners of the audit  firm
-
with public  deposits/deposits of Rs 50 crore and above
The need for good corporate  governance has been gaining increased emphasis over the years. Globally,  Companies are adopting best corporate practices to increase the investors’ confidence  as also that of other stakeholders. Scrutiny of the books of account conducted  by auditors rotated periodically would add further value in strengthening  corporate governance.
In this context, it would  be desirable if NBFCs with public deposits / deposits of Rs 50 crore and above, stipulate rotation  of partners of audit firms appointed for auditing the company. The partner/s of  the Chartered Accountant firm conducting the audit could be rotated every three  years. However, the partner so rotated will be eligible for conducting the  audit of the NBFC after an interval of three years, if the NBFC, so decides.  Companies may incorporate appropriate terms in the letter of appointment of the  firm of auditors and ensure its compliance.
