Dear Sir,
Information from Unauthenticated Sources – Advisory to banks
In the wake of the withdrawal of legal tender character from the Specified Bank Notes (SBNs), Reserve Bank of India has been, from time to time, issuing instructions to the banks through the website of RBI (
www.rbi.org.in
) and official
mail
.
2. It has been reported that certain guidelines / instructions purported to be issued by RBI are being circulated in the social media by some unscrupulous elements creating confusion in the minds of the public/ bank personnel.
3. Banks are, therefore, cautioned to abide by only those instructions which are either uploaded on our website (
www.rbi.org.in
) or mailed through the official
mail
.
4. The banks should not rely on other unsecured/ unofficial channels like social media wherein the authenticity of the documents circulated is questionable and not verifiable.
5. Please acknowledge receipt.
Yours faithfully,
(Suman Ray)
General Manager
