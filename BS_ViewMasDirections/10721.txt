Dear Sir,
Withdrawal of Legal Tender Character of existing ₹ 500/- and ₹ 1000/- Bank Notes – Revision in limits
Please refer to Para 1 (ii) of our
circular DCM (Plg) No. 1272/10.27.00/2016-17 dated November 13, 2016
in terms of which the daily limit of withdrawal from recalibrated ATMs was increased from ₹ 2000/- to ₹ 2500/- per day while retaining the same at ₹ 2000 in case of other ATMs with banks until they are re-calibrated.
2. Recalibration of ATMs is being closely monitored and substantial progress has been made. On a review it has been decided to retain the limits unchanged till further instructions. Banks may continue to dispense ₹ 50 and ₹ 100 bank notes through the non –recalibrated ATMs until they are re-calibrated.
3. Please acknowledge receipt.
Yours faithfully,
(Suman Ray)
