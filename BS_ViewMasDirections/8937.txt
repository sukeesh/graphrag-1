Introduction of Information System(IS) Audit for Urban Cooperative Banks
Please refer to our circular UBD  No.POT.PCB.30/09.96.00/2001-02 dated February 12, 2002 advising UCBs to  introduce EDP audit system on perpetual basis. It is observed that since then some of the UCBs have adopted  technology and have been offering electronic banking, tele banking, electronic  clearing/funds transfer, electronic money, smart cards etc to its customers. With a view to integrating the range of  services offered by bank branches, providing better customer services,  generating MIS reports and various reports for regulators and Government of  India, Reserve Bank of India has vide
Circular  UBD CO BPD PCB Cir No 14/09.18.300/2013-14 dated September 11, 2013
prescribed  a calibrated timeline for implementation of CBS for UCBs based on their deposit  size.
In view of the above and having regard to risks  emanating from adoption of technology, there is a need to introduce IS Audit in  UCBs. It is, therefore, advised that
UCBs may adopt an IS audit policy, if not already done, appropriate to its level  of operations, complexity of business  and level of computerization and review  the same at regular intervals in tune with guidelines issued by RBI from time  to time.
UCBs may also  adopt appropriate systems and practices for conducting IS audit on annual basis  covering all the critically important branches (in terms of nature and volume  of business).
Such audits  should be undertaken preferably prior to the statutory audit so that IS audit reports are available to the  statutory auditors well in time for examination and for incorporating comments, if any, in the  audit reports.
IS audit  reports should be placed before the board and compliance should be ensured  within the time frame as outlined in the audit policy.
The above instructions may be implemented during  the current accounting year i.e April 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015.
Yours faithfully,
