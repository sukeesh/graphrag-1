Dear Sir/ Madam
Deregulation of Interest Rates on Non-Resident (External) Rupee (NRE) Deposits
Please refer to our
circular DBOD.Dir.BC.71/13.03.00/2013-14 dated November 29, 2013
advising banks that the freedom to offer interest rates on incremental NRE deposits with maturity of 3 years and above without any ceiling in order to pass on the benefit of exemption provided on such deposits from CRR/ SLR requirements will remain unchanged up to January 31, 2014, subject to review.
2. On a review and in order to give banks some time, it has been decided to extend the above dispensation till February 28, 2014. With effect from March 1, 2014, the interest rate ceiling will revert to the position prior to August 14, 2013, i.e. interest rates offered by banks on NRE deposits cannot be higher than those offered by them on comparable domestic rupee deposits.
3. All other instructions in this regard, as amended from time to time, will remain unchanged.
4. An amending directive DBOD.Dir.BC.89/13.03.00/2013-14 dated January 31, 2014 is
enclosed
.
Yours faithfully,
