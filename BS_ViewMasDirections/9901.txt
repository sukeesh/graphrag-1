Guidance Notes for Securitisation Companies and Reconstruction Companies
‘SARFAESI Act, 2002' had come into effect from June 21, 2002. In exercise of the powers conferred therein, the Bank has framed Guidelines and Directions to SCs/RCs relating to registration and other matters like acquisition of financial assets, prudential norms relating to income recognition, classification of assets, provisioning, accounting standards, capital adequacy, measures for asset reconstruction and deployment of funds.
2. The Bank has evolved a set of instructions which are required to be complied with by all SCs/RCs so that the process of asset reconstruction proceeds on smooth and sound lines. In addition, the Bank has evolved guidance note based on guidelines issued on various matters, gist of which is given below for the guidance of securitization companies or reconstruction companies. The words and expressions used in these notes shall have the same meaning as in the Act.
(1)
Acquisition of Financial Assets
i) Every SC/RC is required to evolve Asset Acquisition Policy within 90 days of getting the certificate of registration which shall, inter alia, provide that the transactions will take place in a transparent manner and at a fair price in a well informed market, and the transactions are executed on arm's length basis by exercise of due diligence.
ii) The share of financial assets to be acquired from the bank / FI should be appropriately and objectively worked out keeping in view the provision in the Act requiring consent of secured creditors holding not less than 60% of the amount outstanding to a borrower for the purpose of enforcement of security interest;
iii) For easy and faster realisability, all the financial assets due from a single debtor to various banks / FIs may be considered for acquisition. Similarly, financial assets having linkages to the same collateral may be considered for acquisition to ensure relatively faster and easy realisation.
iv) Both fund and non-fund based financial assets may be included in the list of assets for acquisition. Assets classified as SMA- 2 in the books of the originator may also be acquired.
v) Acquisition of funded assets should not include takeover of outstanding commitments, if any, of any bank / FI to lend further. Terms of acquisition of security interest in non-fund transactions, should provide for the relative commitments to continue with bank / FI, till demand for funding arises.
vi) Loans not backed by proper documentation should be avoided.
vii) As far as possible, the valuation process should be uniform for assets of same profile and should ensure that the valuation of the financial assets is done in scientific and objective manner. Valuation may be done internally or by engaging an independent agency, depending upon the value of the assets. Ideally, valuation may be entrusted to the committee authorised to approve acquisition of assets, which may carry out the task in line with an Asset Acquisition Policy laid down by the board of directors in this regard.
viii) The assets acquired by SC / RC should be transferred to the trusts set up by the SC/RC at the price at which these were acquired from the originator of the asset. However, there is no restriction on acquisition of assets from banks / FIs directly in the books of trusts set up by SC/RC.
ix) The assets acquired by the SC/RC are required to be resolved within a period which shall normally not exceed five years from the date of acquisition of such assets. However, if the assets remain unresolved at the end of five years from the date of acquisition, the Board of SC/RC may increase the period of realisation up to 8 years from the original date of acquisition of asset subject to conditions.
(2)
Issue of SRs
i) Every SC/RC shall issue the security receipts through the trust set up exclusively for the purpose. The trusteeship of such trust shall vest with the SC/RC.
ii) The trust shall issue security receipts only to QIBs and such SRs shall be transferable / assignable only in favour of other QIBs.
iii) Every SC/RC intending to issue security receipts shall make disclosures in the offer document as prescribed by the Bank from time to time.
iv) Every SC/RC shall invest in the SRs issued by trusts set up for the purpose of securitization an amount not less than 15 % under each scheme.
v) Every SC/RC shall continue to hold a minimum of 15% of the security receipts issued by the SC / RC under each scheme on an ongoing basis till the redemption of all the security receipts issued under each scheme.
vi) QIBs will be entitled to invoke the provisions of Section 7(3) of the SARFAESI Act at the end of 5 years or 8 years i.e as at the end of period of realisation applicable for the particular asset.
42
vii) Every SC/RC shall obtain initial rating/ grading of SRs from an approved CRA within a period of six months from the date of acquisition of assets and declare forthwith, the NAV of the SRs issued by it. Thereafter, SCs/RCs will get the rating / grading of SRs reviewed from an approved CRA as on June 30, and December 31 every year and declare the NAV of SRs forthwith, to enable the QIBs to value their investment in SRs. For arriving at NAV, SC/RC shall get the SRs rated on ‘ recovery rating scale’ and require the rating agencies to disclose the rationale for rating.
3. Application of prudential norms
i) Every SC/RC is required to maintain, on an ongoing basis a capital adequacy ratio which shall not be less than 15% of its total risk weighted assets.
ii) Every SC/RC is required to classify the assets as standard assets or NPAs after taking into account the period of delinquency and other weaknesses having bearing on the realisability of the asset. Such companies are also required to make provisions against the non- performing assets as specified by the Bank from time to time. The classification / provisioning norms will apply only to those assets which are held on the books of SC/RC.
iii) 'Loss Assets' will include financial assets including SRs continued to be held by the SC/RC which has not been realized within the total time frame of 5 years or 8 years, as the case may be.
iv) A SC/RC may invest in equity of another SC/RC or may deploy its surplus funds only in Government securities or as deposits with scheduled commercial banks / SIDBI / NABARD / other such entity as may be specified by RBI from time to time.
v) No SC/RC shall invest in land and building except for its own use up to 10% of the owned fund of the company. However, if any land and building is acquired by SC / RC in the ordinary course of its business of reconstruction while enforcing the security interest, such land and building shall be disposed of within a period of 5 years from the date of its acquisition or such extended time as may be permitted by the Bank.
vi) The income recognition shall be based on recognized accounting principles and all the accounting standards and guidance notes issued by ICAI shall be followed by SC/RC in so far as they are not inconsistent with guidelines and directions issued by the Bank.
(4) Approval of Policy Documents by the Board of Directors
Every SC/RC shall frame Policy Guidelines with the approval of their Board of Directors on issues relating to asset acquisition, rescheduling of debt due from borrowers, settlement of debt payable by the borrowers, issue of SRs and policy regarding deployment of surplus funds. The policy relating to acquisition of financial assets is required to be evolved within 90 days of grant of certificate of registration to SC/RC. Every SC/RC shall maintain a record indicating therein the details of deviations made from the prescriptions of the Board of Directors in the matter of asset acquisition, pricing, etc. and the reasons therefor should be maintained.

(7) Accounting year / Disclosures in the balance sheet.
Every SC/RC shall prepare its balance sheet and profit and loss account as on March 31 every year. In addition to complying with requirements of Schedule VI of the Companies Act, 1956, the SC/RC shall make additional disclosures on various issues as listed in para 15 of the notification No.2 dated April 23, 2003 as amended from time to time.
