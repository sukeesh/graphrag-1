Dear Sir/Madam
Levy of foreclosure charges/pre-payment penalty on Floating Rate Term Loans
Please refer to our
circular DBOD. No. Dir.BC.107/13.03.00/2011-12 dated June 5, 2012
on ‘Home Loans- Levy of Fore-closure Charges/ Pre-payment Penalty’.
2. A reference is invited to
Part B of the First Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement 2014-15 announced on April 1, 2014
proposing certain measures for consumer protection. It was indicated that in the interest of their consumers, banks should consider allowing their borrowers the possibility of prepaying floating rate term loans without any penalty. Accordingly, it is advised that banks will not be permitted to charge foreclosure charges/ pre-payment penalties on all floating rate term loans sanctioned to
individual borrowers
, with immediate effect.
Yours faithfully,
(Prakash Chandra Sahoo)
