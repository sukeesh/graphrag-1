RBI/2014-2015/588
DNBR(PD)CC.No. 02/SCRC/26.03.001/2014-2015

The Chairman / Managing Director /
Chief Executive Officer
All Registered Securitisation Companies /
Reconstruction Companies
Dear Sir,
Resolution period for BIFR/CDR/JLF cases
Please refer to “The Securitisation Companies and Reconstruction Companies (Reserve Bank) Guidelines and Directions, 2003 dated April 23, 2003 (herein after called “the directions”) and
circular DNBS.PD.CC.No. 39/SCRC/26.03.001/2014-15 dated July 01, 2014
.
2. In terms of RBI Guidelines (sub- para 7(6)(ii) and (iii) of Master Circular dated July 1, 2014), the maximum resolution period permitted to SCs/RCs for realisation of stressed assets acquired by them is 8 years. However, in most cases of restructuring proposals of stressed assets, as approved by BIFR / CDR / JLF, the repayment period goes beyond a time frame of 8 years. In such cases, SCs/RCs, who are holding a part of the stressed assets, express their inability to go along with the other lenders beyond 8 years due to the regulatory constraints mentioned above and insist on an exit at the end of 5 or 8 years, thereby jeopardizing the restructuring efforts of the majority lenders.
3. It has therefore been decided to make certain modifications to the existing Directions as under:
For the purpose of the restructuring proposals approved / to be approved by BIFR/CDR/JLF, SC/RCs shall be permitted to accept a resolution period co-terminus with other secured lenders.
In all such cases, the redemption period of Security Receipts (SRs) held against these assets may be extended to be in congruence with the resolution period approved by BIFR/CDR/JLF, subject to the Independent Credit Rating Agencies continuing to positively rate these SRs, i.e. as long as the Net Asset Value of the SRs continue to be positive.
For the purpose of the above sub-paragraphs (1) and (2), the period of realization stipulated under clauses (ii) and (iii) of sub-paragraph (6) of paragraph 7 of the directions shall not be applicable.
4. SCs/RCs may note the above instructions for meticulous compliance.
5. A
