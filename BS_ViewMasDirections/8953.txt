The  Chairman / Managing Director / Chief
Executive  Officer of participants of RTGS
Madam / Sir,
New  features in RTGS System
Please refer to our
circular  DPSS (CO) RTGS No.801/04.04.017/2013-14 dated October 11, 2013
regarding  the launch of new RTGS system and coming into effect of “
RTGS  System Regulations 2013
”. A reference is also invited to Chapter 9 of the  “RTGS System Regulations 2013” wherein it had been indicated that the new  features in RTGS system will be enabled after due notifications to members.
2. The new RTGS system has been  running smoothly and has stabilised. It has hence been decided to enable the ‘Hybrid’  and ‘Future value dated transaction’ features in the system with effect from July  14, 2014. The details regarding operations of these two functionalities are  given in
Annex
.
3. The Hybrid feature will be  configured to do off-setting every 5 minutes. The transactions with normal  priority would be settled in off-setting mechanism, with a maximum of two  attempts i.e. the maximum time a transaction would be in “normal” queue is 10  minutes. If the transactions with normal priority are unable to be settled in  offsetting mode within this time, the priority of the transaction would be  automatically changed to “urgent”. The parameter value will be set to 10%. This  means that 10% of the balance in the settlement A/c would be taken for  settlement in the offsetting mode.
4. The Future Value dated Transaction  would enable the customers / participants to initiate RTGS transactions 3 working  days in advance for settling in RTGS on value date.
5. The circular is issued under  section 10 (2) of Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007, (Act 51 of 2007).
Yours faithfully,
Vijay  Chugh
Chief  General Manager
Encl: As above.
Annex
1. Hybrid  feature
a) The  RTGS system supports a new and unique way to handle large volume of payments  using a minimum amount of liquidity from the Participants’ settlement accounts.
b) From  the priority point of view, the RTGS system can handle two types of payments:
Urgent payments
Normal payments
c) Both  categories are implemented over the same ISO20022 standard and share the same  rules and regulations. However, while the urgent payments are processed as soon  as they are received by the RTGS and using as much liquidity as required from  the settlement account of the sending Participant, the normal payments are  processed differently, following some strict processing rules which do not  apply to the urgent payments. These rules are:
The normal payments are not settled  immediately, even though the sending bank may have sufficient funds in its  settlement account;
The normal payments may settle only at periodic  time intervals which are controlled centrally by system parameter of RTGS;
The RTGS does not take into consideration the  pending normal transactions in the calculation for IDL funding request to CBS;
The settlement of normal payments can occur  only if several participants, simultaneously, have sent normal payments to each  other. If 0 % of allowance is set in parameter value (centrally), in that  scenario the transactions would look for settling transactions without using  any amount from the settlement account, i.e., settlement will happen purely on  offsetting mode. If an allowance of 1% is set in the parameter in that  scenario, the transactions would try to settle using a percentage of the amount  from the settlement account.
If the condition for the settlement of normal  payments is not possible, the system will automatically promote the normal  payments to the urgent payment stream, after a predefined timeout parameter.  Once promoted, the transactions will be processed according to the urgent  payments’ settlement rules.
From the format point of view, the field that  designates a payment as normal or urgent is called
InstrPrty
and its  content should be:
NORM – for normal payments
HIGH – for urgent payments
Process flow
The normal payments will have the following  flow in RTGS:
1. A  new normal message is received, validated and (if successful) placed in the  ENTER status queue.
2. The  item will stay with status ENTER until the first gridlock cycle for the normal  stream runs. After the cycle is completed, the item will change its status to  COMPLETE (if the item was settled) or PENDING (if the item was not included in  any gridlock solution).
3. Subsequent  gridlock cycles will attempt to settle the item (every 5 minutes), considering  other normal payments found in the system. If a solution is found by the normal  payment stream gridlock resolution process, the respective transactions are  updated to status COMPLETE and the respective output messages are generated to  the sender and receiver.
4. If a  solution is not found within the timeout period (10 minutes) for the normal  payments, the item is promoted to the urgent stream. The change is visible to  the end user when listing the transaction and also in the audit trail of the  item.
5. Once  the transaction is promoted to urgent, if the sending Participant does not have  the required liquidity, the IDL funding may be invoked depending on the TTC of  the item.
Example
The following table demonstrates how  this feature will work. T1, T2, T3 etc. indicates the transaction initiated by banks.  The bank initiating the transaction is debited and beneficiary bank is  credited.

The following table  explains how these transactions would be settled in off-setting mode when no  liquidity is used from the settlement account of the banks or when a percentage  of the amount in the settlement account is used for settling the transactions  in offsetting mode. The parameter value indicates the percentage of the liquidty, that  can be used for settlement of the transactions in offsetting mode (transactions  with normal priority).

In the
example 1
the parameter  value is set to 0% i.e. no amount will be utilised from the settlement account  to settle these transactions. Hence, none of the above transactions listed (T1,  T2, T3, T4 and T5 will be settled) as there is no transaction with equal value  to offset (settle) the transaction.
In
example 2,
the parameter  value is set to 5%. The maximum amount  which can be used from the settlement account is Rs.50,000 (i.e.5% of Rs. 10,00,000).  The transaction T1, T2 and T3 are settled. Though the maximum which can be used  from settlement account is Rs.50,000 the actual amount utilised from A’s  settlement account is 40,000 to settle these transactions. i.e. Rs.40,000 is  utilised to settle transactions T1, T2 and T3 amounting to Rs.14,40,000. However,  transaction T4 and T5 could not be settled as liquidity requirement for  settling these transactions was more than Rs.50,000.
In
example 3
the parameter  value is set to 10%. The maximum amount which can be utilised from the  settlement account for settlement of the transactions with normal priority is  Rs. 1,00,000. In this case, all the transactions listed (T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5)  are settled by usitlising Rs.80,000 from settlement account of B.
2. Future Value Transactions
1. This  feature will allow Participants to send RTGS payments which are not submitted  for settlement immediately, but at a later date. This option will facilitate  the scheduling of certain important payments days in advance.
2. The  RTGS will not attempt to settle them immediately but it will wait until the  respective value date is reached.
3. The  value date must be within a certain time period which is controlled by system  parameter of the application (3 working days). When sending a future value  payment, the sender must ensure that the respective value date is a working  date according to the present RTGS calendar. If the value date is set on a  non-working date, the payment will be rejected immediately.
4. A  future value dated transaction can be manually canceled at any time, as long as  its status is FUTURE, from the Settlement / Transaction / Cancel menu option.  (The cancel operations requires an approve confirmation.)
5. When  a Participant is removed, any future value payments already sent by the said participant  and stored in RTGS will be automatically canceled. The sender will be notified  about the cancelation using standard notification messages.
6. If the calendar of  RTGS is modified by RBI and as a result some future value payments already present  in the system have their value date falling on a non-working date, the  respective transactions will not be canceled. The items will remain in the  system and they will be submitted to the settlement process on the first  working day following the original value date.
