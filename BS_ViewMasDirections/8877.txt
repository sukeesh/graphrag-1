Madam/Dear Sir,
Treatment of RIDF and certain other funds under  priority sector
It has been decided to include the  outstanding deposits placed by scheduled commercial banks under Rural  Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) and certain other funds established with  NABARD, on account of their shortfall in lending to priority sector as part of  indirect agriculture under priority sector classification.
2. Accordingly, the  outstanding deposits as on March 31st of the current year under  RIDF, Warehouse Infrastructure Fund, Short Term Co-operative Rural Credit  Refinance Fund and Short Term RRB Fund with NABARD will be treated as part of indirect  agriculture and will count towards overall priority sector target achievement. The  outstanding deposits under the above funds with NABARD as on preceding March 31st  will form part of Adjusted Net Bank Credit.
3. These guidelines are applicable with effect from  March 31, 2014. The paragraph (II) (iii)  of the
master circular  RPCD.CO.Plan.BC 9 /04.09.01/2013-14 July  01, 2013
on computation of ANBC is amended accordingly.
Yours faithfully,
(T V Rao)
Deputy General Manager
