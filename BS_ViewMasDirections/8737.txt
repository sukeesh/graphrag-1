Dear Sir,
Utilisation  of Floating Provisions/Counter Cyclical Provisioning Buffer
Please refer to our
circular  DBOD.No.BP.BC.89/21.04.048/2005-06 dated June 22, 2006
and
DBOD.No.BP.BC. 68/21.04.048/2006-07 dated March 13, 2007
on creation, accounting, disclosures and utilisation  of floating provisions by banks. Banks may also refer to our
circular  No.DBOD.No.BP.BC.87/21.04.048/2010-11 dated April 21, 2011
on  creation and utilisation of ‘countercyclical provisioning buffer’, wherein we  had advised that this buffer will be allowed to be used by banks for making  specific provisions for non-performing assets, inter alia, during periods of  system wide downturn, with the prior approval of RBI.
2. Accordingly, it has been decided,  as a countercyclical measure, that banks may utilise upto 33 per cent of  countercyclical provisioning buffer/floating provisions held by them as on March  31, 2013, for making specific provisions for non-performing assets, as per the policy  approved by their Board of Directors.
3. Utilisation of  countercyclical provisioning buffer/floating provisions under this measure may  be over and above the utilisation of countercyclical provisioning  buffer/floating provisions for the purpose of making accelerated/additional  provisions as proposed in the Reserve Bank’s Press Release dated January 30,  2014 on “
Early  Recognition of Financial Distress, Prompt Steps for Resolution and Fair  Recovery for Lenders: Framework for Revitalising Distressed Assets in the  Economy
”.
4. In this connection, banks may also refer  to the Discussion Paper on Introduction of Dynamic Loan Loss Provisioning  Framework for Banks in India dated March 30, 2012, wherein banks are required  to build up ‘Dynamic Provisioning Account’ during good times and utilise the  same during downturn. Under the proposed framework, banks are expected to either  compute parameters such as probability of default, loss given default, etc. for  different asset classes to arrive at long term average annual expected loss or use  the standardised parameters prescribed by Reserve Bank of India towards computation  of Dynamic Provisioning requirement. Dynamic loan loss provisioning framework  is expected to be in place with improvement in the system. Meanwhile, banks should  develop necessary capabilities to compute their long term average annual  expected loss for different asset classes, for switching over to the dynamic  provisioning framework.
Yours faithfully,
