). It would be observed  therefrom that the Government of India has prescribed the minimum eligibility  criteria for appointment to the post of Chief Executive Officer of Multi-State  Urban Co-operative Banks.
2. It  has been brought to our notice that some of the UCBs registered under the  Multi-State Co-operative Societies Act either have not laid down the ‘fit and  proper criteria’ for appointment of Chief Executive Officer in their bank or  the same is not being adhered to as per the above guidelines.
3. As  the ‘fit and proper criteria’ have been prescribed pursuant to the  recommendations of TAFCUB, you are advised to ensure that the guidelines for  appointment of Chief Executive Officer of the bank are followed in letter and  spirit.
Yours  faithfully,
(Scenta Joy)
