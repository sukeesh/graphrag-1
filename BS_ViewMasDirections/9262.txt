2.  Under the extant guidelines relating to hedging of currency risk of probable  exposures based on past performance, resident importers are allowed to book  contracts up to 50 per cent of the eligible limit. The eligible limit is  computed as the average of the previous three financial years’ import turnover  or the previous year’s actual import turnover, whichever is higher.
3. On a review of the evolving market conditions and with a view to  bringing at par both exporters and importers for hedging of currency risk of  probable exposures based on past performance, it has been decided to allow  importers to book forward contracts, under the past performance route, up to  100 per cent of the eligible limit.  Importers who have already booked contracts up to previous limit of 50  per cent in the current financial year, shall be eligible for difference  arising out of the enhanced limits. All other operational guidelines, terms and  conditions shall apply mutatis mutandis.
4.  AD Category-I banks may bring the contents of this circular to the notice of  their constituents and customers.
