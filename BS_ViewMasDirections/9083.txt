The Chairmen/Chief Executive Officers,
All Regional Rural Banks / State and Central Co-operative Banks
Dear Sir/Madam,
Security Incident  Tracking Platform- Reporting thereon
Information on Security, particularly  security incidents, external attacks, internal compromises etc. is unique to  each bank. Sharing of such information/ incidents/experiences would greatly  benefit Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) / State and Central Co-operative Banks  (StCBs/CCBs) in taking appropriate preventive/corrective measures. As of now,  information sharing among RRBs/StCBs/CCBs on these issues is not very  prevalent.
2. The National Security Council (NSC) has  requested IDRBT to set up necessary facilities to enable sharing of information  among banks and also dissemination of information on emerging security threats.  Towards this end, IDRBT has developed a Security Incident Tracking Platform  where banks would be able to report security incidents in an anonymous manner;  thus keeping the information reported by the banks confidential. The platform  will be hosted on the INFINET and the access provided only to Chief Information  Security Officers (CISOs) of respective banks. IDRBT is simultaneously making  arrangements to gather global threat intelligence from various sources in  coordination with CERT-In.
3. CISOs of RRBs/StCBs/CCBs are advised to  make use of the platform developed by IDRBT by reporting all Information  Security related incidents in the above platform. This would not only enable  building a repository of security incidents related information for the banking  Industry but also help in fine-tuning policies relating to information security  from time to time.
4. Please acknowledge the receipt of this  circular to our Regional Office.
Yours faithfully,
(A.Udgata)
Principal  Chief General Manager
