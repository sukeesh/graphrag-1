Madam / Dear Sir,
Know Your Customer (KYC) Guidelines - Accounts  of Proprietary Concerns
Please refer to paragraph 2.5(ii) of our
Master  Circular no. UBD.BPD.(PCB) MC.No.16/12.05.001/2014-15 dated July 1, 2014
and paragraph  2.5 (vi) of
Master Circular RPCD. RRB.RCB.AML.BC. No. 02/07.51.018/ 2014-15 dated  July 1, 2014
on KYC norms and our
Circular UBD.BPD.CO/NSB1/11/12.03.000/2009-10  dated September 29, 2009
and RPCD
Circular RPCD.CO.RF.AML.BC.No.83/07.40.00/2009-10  dated May 12, 2010
prescribing norms for opening of bank accounts in respect of  sole proprietary firms and subsequent circulars issued in this regard.
2. Reserve Bank has been receiving  representations pointing out difficulties in complying with the requirement of  furnishing two documents as activity proof while opening accounts of sole  proprietary firms in certain cases. It is possible that in some types of  activities there is genuine difficulty in procuring two such documents. The  matter has, therefore, been reviewed with a view to ease the process of opening  bank accounts of proprietary concerns in such cases. The default rule is that  any two documents, out of those listed in paragraphs of the Master Circulars  mentioned above, should be provided as activity proof by a proprietary concern.  However, in cases where the banks are satisfied that it is not possible to furnish two such documents, they would have  the discretion to accept only one of those documents as activity proof. In such  cases, the banks, however, would have to undertake contact point verification,  collect such information as would be required to establish the existence of  such firm, confirm, clarify and satisfy themselves that the business activity  has been verified from the address of the proprietary concern.
3. It is also clarified here that the list of  registering authorities indicated in paragraph 2.5(ii) of our
Master Circular  no. UBD.BPD.(PCB) MC. No.16/12.05.001/2014-15 dated July 1, 2014
and paragraph 2.  5 (vi) of
Master Circular RPCD.RRB.RCB.AML.BC. No.02/07.51. 018/2014-15 dated  July 1, 2014
on KYC norms is only illustrative and therefore includes license /  certificate of practice issued in the name of the proprietary concern by any  professional body incorporated under a statute, as one of the documents to  prove the activity of the proprietary concern.
4. UCBs/DCCBs/StCBs may revise their KYC policy  in the light of the above instructions and ensure strict adherence to the same.
Yours faithfully,
(Suma Varma)
Principal Chief General Manager
