1.  Legal Requirements
The opening of branches by banks is  governed by the provisions of Section 23 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. In terms of these provisions, banks cannot  open a new place of business in India or abroad or change otherwise than within  the same city, town or village, the location of the existing place of business  without the prior approval of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Thus, it is  mandatory for RRBs to seek prior approval / licence from Rural Planning and  Credit Department (RPCD) of RBI before opening of new branches / offices.
1.1. General Policy on Branch  Licensing
The Boards of Directors of RRBs are  required to decide on the policy and strategy for setting up new branches,  taking into account the yearly business plan, potential for business and  profitability of the proposed branches, efficacy of the internal control  system, redeployment of staff where surplus manpower has been identified,  extension of prompt and cost-effective customer service to the clientele etc.
RRBs should obtain prior approval of  their Boards of Directors before applying for opening / merger / shifting /  conversion of branches / offices etc. No separate approval of the sponsor bank  is required. Further, approval of the sub-group of District Consultative  Committee (DCC) will also not be required for opening of branches. However, in  case of shifting / merger / conversion of branches, approval of the sub-group  of DCC will be required.
RRBs  should submit applications to the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve  Bank, through the respective Regional Office of NABARD in the prescribed application Form  VI (Rule 12) of Banking Companies Rules, 1949 (Annex I),  which  will give its comments on the merits of the application. The RRBs should  forward an advance copy of the application to the concerned Regional Office of  the Reserve Bank.
In  order to expedite the process of disposal of applications powers have been  delegated  to the Regional Offices of the  Reserve Bank to take a decision on the applications of RRBs for opening,  shifting, merger or conversion of branches without reference to the concerned  Empowered Committees(ECs). If required, the Regional Offices of the Reserve  Bank may consult the concerned State Government.
RRBs are required to obtain prior  approval of RBI for opening  new branches  in Tier 1  centres. The applications will  be considered on a very selective basis on merits of each case. In addition to  the conditions laid down in para 1.2, the overall financial position of the  RRB, quality of its management, efficacy of the internal control system, CBS  compliance and other relevant factors will be considered by RBI.
RRBs are permitted to open branches  in Tier 2 to Tier 6 centers (with population of up to 99,999 as per Census 2001  - details of classification of centers tier-wise furnished in
Annex IV
)  without having the need to take prior permission from Reserve Bank of India in  each case, subject  to reporting, provided  they fulfill the conditions laid down in para 1.3. RRBs which do not satisfy  the said conditions may approach the Regional Office of RBI for prior approval.  Their applications will be considered on the basis of conditions laid down in  para 1.2.
There  is a need to step up the opening of branches in unbanked rural centres in order  to meet the objectives of increasing banking penetration and financial  inclusion rapidly. It is also vitally important to meet the targets set out for  providing banking services in all villages by opening more number of brick and  mortar branches in unbanked rural centres, besides the use of Business  Correspondents.
RRBs should allocate at least 25 percent of the total number  of branches proposed to be opened during a year in unbanked rural (Tier 5 and  Tier 6) centres. An unbanked rural centre would mean a rural (Tier 5 and Tier  6) centre that does not have a brick and mortar structure of any scheduled  commercial bank for customer based banking transactions.
In  order to take financial inclusion to the next stage of providing universal  coverage and facilitating Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT), RRBs are advised  to draw up the next Financial Inclusion Plan (FIP) for the period 2013-16.
RRBs  are further, advised that they may consider front-loading (prioritising) the  opening of branches in unbanked rural centres over a 3 year cycle co-terminus  with their FIP(2013-16) to facilitate speedier branch expansion in unbanked  rural centres for ensuring seamless roll out of the Direct Benefit Transfer  (DBT) / EBT Scheme of the Government of India,. The requirement of allocating  at least 25 per cent of total number of branches proposed to be opened during a  year in unbanked rural (Tier 5 and Tier 6) centres will continue. Credit will  be given for branches opened in unbanked rural centres in excess of 25 per cent  in a year which will be carried forward to the subsequent year of the FIP.
1.2 Conditions for Opening of  Branches with Prior Approval of RBI
RRBs should fulfill the following  conditions, to become eligible to open new branch/es :
(i) No default in maintenance of SLR  and CRR during the last two years;
(ii) Operational profits are being  made;
(iii) Net worth shows improvement;
(iv) Net NPA ratio does not exceed 8  per cent.
1.3 Relaxation in Branch  Licensing Policy
RRBs are permitted to open branches  in Tier 2 to Tier 6 centers (with population of up to 99,999 as per Census 2001  - details of classification of centers tier-wise furnished in
Annex IV
)  without having the need to take permission from Reserve Bank of India in each  case, subject  to reporting, provided  they fulfill the following conditions as per the latest inspection report :
i) CRAR of at least 9%;
ii) Net NPA  ratio less than 5%;
iii) No default in CRR / SLR for the  last year;
iv) Net profit in the last financial  year;
v) CBS compliant
RRBs eligible to open branches in  Tier 2 to Tier 6 centres may do so without prior approval of RBI and approach  the Regional Office of RBI for, post-facto automatic, issue of the licence/s. The  licence should be displayed in the premise of the branch so opened for  information of its customers / public to instill confidence in them that the  bank branch is authorized to conduct banking business. The details of the  branches thus opened should be reported, in the prescribed format
(
Annex V
),  to the concerned Regional Office of RBI (RPCD) and Department of Statistics and  Information Management (DSIM) as stated in para 12(iii) of the Master Circular.
2. Opening of Branches / Regional Offices
2.1. Branches at Rural /  Semi-Urban / Urban and Metropolitan Centres
RRBs can identify rural centres  (population up to ten thousand), semi-urban centres (population more than ten  thousand but up to one lakh), urban centres (population more than one lakh but  up to ten lakh) and metropolitan centres (population more than ten lakh) for  opening of branches depending upon the business potential and profitability of  the proposed branches.
Note :
Population criteria mentioned  above will be as per the latest census report figures of the centre (revenue  unit and not locality).
2.2 Service Branch
RRBs may be allowed to set up  Service Branches / Central Processing Centres (CPCs) / Back Offices exclusively  to attend to back office functions such as data processing, verification and  processing of documents, issuance of cheque books, demand drafts etc. and other  functions incidental to their banking business. These offices should have no  interface with customers and would not be allowed to be converted into General  Banking branches. These offices would be treated on par with a branch and RRBs  shall be required to obtain necessary licence from the concerned Regional  Office of RBI (RPCD).
2.3 Regional Offices
RRBs will be allowed to open one  Regional Office (RO) for every 50 branches. RRBs having up to 50 branches will  be under the direct control of the Head Office, without any intermediate tier.  The cases of RRBs, which require relaxation in the above norm in regard to the  number of branches to be covered by one RO due to geographical / other  conditions, will be examined by the EC and referred to Central Office, RPCD for  consideration.
The ROs are not permitted to transact  any banking business. However, RRBs are required to obtain licences from the  concerned Regional Office of RBI (RPCD) prior to functioning / opening of these  offices. RRBs can either shift or close / merge these offices at their  discretion without prior approval of RBI, but they are required to ensure that  the licence is submitted to the concerned Regional Office of RBI (RPCD) for  getting the new address incorporated in the licence at the earliest, but not  later than three months from the date of shifting. As regards closure / merger  of such offices, the licence has to be surrendered to the concerned Regional  Office of RBI (RPCD) for cancellation immediately after the closure / merger of  the office under advice to the DSIM of RBI.
2.4. Validity of Authorisations  and Licences
Presently authorisations are issued  to RRBs for opening of branches based on the requests received from them  (through NABARD) on the merits of each case. With a view to ensuring  expeditious utilisation of authorisations and actual establishment of the  branch, it has been decided to limit the validity of the authorisation to a  maximum period of two years.
RRBs are required to obtain  necessary licence prior to the opening of an office / branch from the concerned  Regional Office of RBI (RPCD). It is observed that some RRBs take unduly long  time to approach the Regional Offices for grant of a licence after the  authorisation has been issued. It is also observed that some RRBs obtain a  licence, but do not open the branch for a considerable period of time and  approach the Regional Offices for revalidation of the licences time and again.  RRBs should, therefore, approach the Regional Office for issue of a licence  only after the infrastructure is ready for opening of the office / branch.
Further, RRBs often approach for  approval for change in name of a branch due to change in name of the locality  or street / road where the branch is located. Since there is no change in  location of the branch, banks need not seek approval or approach for amendment to  licence in the matter, but intimate the change to the concerned Regional Office  of RBI (RPCD) and DSIM, Mumbai. Changes may also take place due to change in  name of taluk / district or reorganisation of districts or formation of new  States. Under such circumstances, too, RRBs need not forward the relevant  licence/s to the Regional Office for amendment and may adopt the changed name  on the basis of Government Notification, under advice to the concerned Regional  Office of RBI (RPCD) and DSIM, Mumbai.
In case any alteration in any name  is to be made for avoiding confusion between branches of various banks bearing  the same name in the same locality or on account of other justifiable  circumstances, such requests should be addressed to the concerned Regional Office  of RBI (RPCD) and while forwarding such requests, the relative licences,  together with the covering letters, should also be sent.
2.5. Requirement for Conduct of  Government Business
RRBs are permitted  to undertake State Government business as sub-agents of the Sponsor Bank with  the prior approval from the concerned State Government and RBI. The Sponsor  Bank should submit the proposal to the concerned Regional Office of RBI in  accordance with DGBA guidelines issued vide circular DGBA.GAD.No.H.15327/31.01.004/2006-07  dated April 19, 2007, for issue of necessary authorisation.
3.  Shifting of Branches
3.1 At Rural Centres
The shifting of branches in rural  centres may be effected by RRBs themselves without obtaining the prior approval  of RBI, subject to the condition that both the existing and proposed centres  are within the same block, and that the relocated branch would be able to cater  adequately to the banking needs of the villages served by the existing branch.
3.2 At Semi-Urban Centres
RRBs may shift their branches at  semi-urban centres within the same locality / municipal ward without the prior  approval of RBI. It should, however, be ensured that the locality / ward is not  rendered unbanked due to the shifting of branch/es.
3.3 At Urban / Metropolitan Centres
RRBs may shift their branches in  urban / metropolitan centres within the same locality / municipal ward without  the prior approval of RBI.
Regarding shifting of branches  outside the locality / municipal ward at Semiurban / Urban / Metropolitan centres,  RRBs have to obtain prior approval of the concerned Regional Office of RBI  (RPCD).
3.4.
RRBs  may shift their branches as indicated above (paras 3.1 to 3.3),  but ensure that the licence of the  branch is submitted to the concerned Regional Office of RBI (RPCD) for getting  the new address incorporated therein at the earliest but not later than three  months from the date of the shifting of the branch.
4. Conversion of Full-fledged Branches into Satellite /  Mobile Offices
RRBs may themselves decide the need  for conversion of the existing loss making branches into satellite / mobile  offices keeping in view the cost-benefit aspect, the likely inconvenience that  may be caused to the existing clientele, the effect of the conversion on the  performance in the preparation of district credit plan and priority sector  lending. With a view to providing better customer service in rural areas, RRBs  may also convert their satellite offices into full-fledged branches after  obtaining concurrence from the EC and RRBs should also obtain necessary licence  from the concerned Regional Office of RBI (RPCD).
4.1 Satellite Offices
The following guidelines may be  followed by the RRBs in respect of satellite offices :
a) The satellite office should be  established at fixed premises in the surrounding villages. It  should be controlled and operated from a base  branch located at central village / block headquarters.
b) Each satellite office should  function on a few specified days (at least twice) in a week at specified hours.
c) All types of banking transactions  may be conducted at the satellite office.
d) The customers of the satellite  office may be permitted to transact business at the base branch on  non-operating days of such office.
e) While separate ledgers /  registers / scrolls may be maintained for each satellite office, all the  transactions carried out thereat should be incorporated in the books of account  of the base branch.
f) The staff attached to the base  branch, preferably consisting of a member of supervisory staff, a cashier-cum-clerk  and an armed guard, may be deputed to the satellite office.
g) Adequate arrangements for  insurance of furniture, cash-in-transit, etc. may be made.
Conversion of branches into  satellite offices at centres other than rural is not permissible
4.2. Mobile Offices
The scheme of mobile offices  envisages the extension of banking facilities through a well protected van with  arrangements for two or three officials of the bank sitting in it with books,  safe containing cash, etc. The mobile unit would visit the places proposed to  be served by it on certain specified days / hours. The mobile offices would be  attached to a branch of the RRB. The mobile office/s should not visit the rural  places which are served by co-operative banks and places served by regular  offices of commercial banks.
5. Opening of Extension Counters
RRBs, with the approval of their  Boards of Directors, can open extension counters at the premises of the  institutions of which they are principal bankers after obtaining a licence from  the concerned Regional Office of RBI (RPCD) for the purpose. An extension  counter can be opened within the premises of big offices / factories,  hospitals, military units, educational institutions, residential colonies,  shopping complexes where there is a large complement of staff / workers,  students, who because of their identical working hours and non-availability of  banking facilities at a reasonable distance find it difficult to carry out  their banking transactions. Apart from above, RRBs can also set up extension  counters after obtaining licence from the concerned Regional Office of RBI  (RPCD) at places of worship and market places. The condition of being principal  bankers however would not apply in such cases.
The extension counter should carry  out limited type of banking business, such as :
- deposit / withdrawal transactions
- issuing and encashment of drafts  and mail transfers
- issue and encashment of travellers  cheques
- sale of gift cheques
- collection of bills
- advances against fixed deposits of  their customers (within the sanctioning power of the concerned officials at the  extension counter)
- facility of safe deposit locker  (provided adequate security arrangements are made).
Further, if the extension counter  proposes to undertake government business, it would require prior approval from  the concerned Government authority and RBI as stipulated under
paragraph 2.5
above.
RRBs should furnish particulars of  the proposed extension counters in Parts I and II of the format, given in
Annex II
, to the concerned Regional Offices of  RBI (RPCD), while applying for a licence prior to opening of the extension  counter.
6. Upgradation of Extension Counters into Full-fledged  Branches
6.1 RRBs should approach the  concerned Regional Office of RBI (RPCD) for prior approval for upgrading an  extension counter into a full-fledged branch. The proposal is considered if the  following conditions are fulfilled :
- The extension counter has been  functioning for a minimum period of five years.
- The number of deposit accounts exceeded  2000 during the last one-year.
- The average deposits (i.e. on a  monthly basis) for the last three years are not less than Rs.2 crore.
6.2 The proposals, wherein the above  conditions are not fulfilled entirely but otherwise the concerned extension counters  have grown so as to be fit for conversion into branches, are considered on  merit.
7.  Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)
7.1 RRBs need not obtain permission  of RBI for installation of ATMs at branches and extension counters for which  they hold licences issued by RBI. RRBs should, however, report to the concerned  Regional Office of the Reserve Bank (RPCD) and DSIM as and when an ATM is  installed at a branch or an extension counter.
7.2 In case any RRB wishes to set up  an off-site ATM in its area of operation, it may do so after assessing the cost  and benefit. Prior approval of RBI need not be obtained, but on opening of such  ATMs, RRBs should immediately inform the respective Regional Office of the  Reserve Bank (RPCD) for the purpose of getting a formal authorisation for the  place of business.
8. Ultra Small Branches
An  intermediate brick and mortar structure (Ultra Small Branch) may be set up  between the base branch and Business Correspondent (BC) locations so as to  provide support to about 8-10 BC Units at a reasonable distance of 3-4  kilometres. These could be either newly set up or by conversion of the BC  outlets. Such Ultra Small Branches should have minimum infrastructure such as a  Core Banking Solution (CBS) terminal linked to a pass book printer and a safe  for cash retention for operating large customer transactions and would have to  be managed full time by bank officers / employees. It is expected that such an  arrangement would lead to efficiency in cash management, documentation,  redressal of customer grievances and close supervision of BC operations. These  could be satellite offices or regular branches as the case may be and licences  may be issued, as required, depending on the status, in accordance with the  branch licencing policy.
9. Business Facilitator /  Business Correspondent Model
With the objective of  ensuring greater financial inclusion and increasing the outreach of the banking  sector, Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) have been permitted to use the services of  intermediaries in providing financial and banking services through the use of  Business Facilitator / Business Correspondent Model as per the guidelines  issued by DBOD in this regard. The list of circulars issued by DBOD  and RPCD is included in the ‘Appendix-List of circulars’.
10. Merger of Loss making Branches
Where  two loss making branches of any RRB are in close proximity to each other (i.e.  within a distance of about 5 kms.), the RRB may consider merging the two  branches with a view to rationalising the spatial spread and reducing establishment  / operating costs.
11. Classification / Re-classification of Centres
RRBs  are advised to ascertain the population group classification of the centres of  which they are not sure, from RBI, DSIM, Banking Statistics Division, C-8/9,  Bandra Kurla Complex, Bandra (East), Mumbai - 400 051 before approaching RPCD  for opening of new branches. Any query with regard to reclassification of  centres also may be referred to DSIM by the Head Office of the RRB along with  relevant documents such as Gazette Notifications, etc. in support of the  change.
12. Submission of Returns on Branch Banking
(i) Immediately on opening of a  place of business, all RRBs are required to inform the date of opening and the  postal address of the office / branch to the Central Office and the concerned  Regional Office of RPCD.
(ii) In terms of Rule 13 of the Banking Regulations (Companies) Rules, 1949, the RRB is required to  submit a list relating to its offices in India in Form VII within a period of  one month from the close of every quarter to the office of RBI situated in the  state in which its Head Office is located.
(iii) Further, RRBs should submit returns in the  Proformae given in
Annex III
, as advised in
Circular
RPCD.CO.RRB.BL.BC.10/03.05.90A/2005-06
(RBI/2005-06/46) dated July 6, 2005
, relating to the new offices / branches  opened and change in status due to merger, etc. of existing offices / branches  effected during the quarter to DSIM (Banking Statistics Division) and the  concerned Regional Office of RPCD within 14 days of the month succeeding the  quarter to which they relate. While submitting the current quarter Returns, the  previous quarter's reference must be quoted in the forwarding letter. 'Nil'  Returns must be sent to DSIM and the concerned Regional Office of RPCD in case  there is nothing to report on opening / closing / change in status, etc., of  any office / branch / NAIO (Not Administratively Independent Offices like Extension  Counters, Satellite Offices, ATMs, etc.) during a quarter.
