Dear Sir,
Deferred Tax Liability on Special Reserve created  under Section 36(1) (viii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961
Please refer to our  mailbox clarification dated November 6, 2009 with respect to the 'Special  Reserve' created by banks under Section 36(1) (viii) of Income Tax Act, 1961  (hereinafter referred to as ‘Special Reserve’), in terms of which, only the net  amount of such Special Reserve (net of tax payable) should be taken into  account for the purpose of computation of Tier-I capital.
2. In this context, it has been observed  that some banks are not creating deferred tax liability (DTL) on Special  Reserve as per Accounting Standard 22: ‘
Accounting for taxes on Income’
(AS  22)on the grounds that they do not intend to withdraw from such Reserve  in the future. In many cases banks have formalised  such intent by having resolutions passed by their Boards or Committees to this  effect.
3. The matter regarding creation of DTL on Special  Reserve has been examined and banks are advised that, as a matter of prudence,  DTL should be created on Special Reserve.
4. For this purpose, banks may take the following  course of action:
a) If the expenditure  due to the creation of DTL on Special Reserve as at March 31, 2013 has not  been fully charged to the Profit and Loss account, banks may adjust the same  directly from Reserves. The amount so  adjusted may be appropriately disclosed in the Notes to Accounts of the  financial statements for the financial year 2013-14.
b) DTL for amounts  transferred to Special Reserve from the year ending March 31, 2014 onwards should  be charged to the Profit and Loss Account of that year.
5. In view of the  requirement to create DTL on Special Reserve, banks may reckon the entire  Special Reserve for the purpose of computing Tier-I Capital.
Yours faithfully
