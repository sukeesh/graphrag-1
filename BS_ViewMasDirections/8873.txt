Advance against Pledge of Gold/ Silver Ornaments

The Chief Executive Officers of
All Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks
Dear  Sir / Madam,
Advance  against Pledge of Gold/ Silver Ornaments
Please refer to
circular UBD.PCB.Cir.No.24/13.05.001/ 08-09  dated November 10, 2008
, wherein Urban  Cooperative Banks (UCBs) were advised to observe safeguards in order to  mitigate the inherent risks attached to sanction of loans and advances against  Gold / Silver ornaments.
2. As  a prudential measure, it has now been decided to prescribe a Loan to Value  (LTV) Ratio of not exceeding 75 per cent for UCBsâ€™ lending against gold  jewellery (including bullet repayment loans against pledge of gold jewellery).  Therefore, henceforth loans sanctioned by UCBs should not exceed 75 per cent of  the value of gold ornaments and jewellery.
3. In order to standardize the valuation and make  it more transparent to the borrower, it has been decided that gold jewellery  accepted as security/collateral will have to be valued at the average of the  closing price of 22 carat gold for the preceding 30 days as quoted by the India  Bullion and Jewellers Association Ltd. [Formerly known as the Bombay Bullion  Association Ltd. (BBA)]. If the gold is of purity less than 22 carats, the bank should translate the  collateral into 22 carat and value the exact grams of the collateral. In other  words, jewellery of lower purity of gold shall be valued proportionately.
4. It  is reiterated that UCBs should continue to observe necessary and usual  safeguards and also have a suitable policy for lending against gold jewellery  with the approval of their Boards of Directors.
Yours  faithfully,
(P.  K. Arora)
General  Manager
