The Chief Executive Officers of
All Primary  (Urban) Co-operative Banks
Madam/Dear Sir,
Performance Audit of Agricultural Debt Waiver & Debt Relief Scheme 2008
Please refer to our
Circular  UBD.BPD. (PCB) Cir. No.40/13.05.006/2012-13 dated March 7, 2013
, in terms  of which Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) were advised to conduct  complete verification of list of beneficiaries  under ADWDRS, 2008 and take corrective steps as indicated therein. In this  connection, attention of UCBs is invited to para 1(iii) thereof, wherein it was  advised that cases of extending benefits to ineligible beneficiaries must be  dealt with on top priority and full recoveries as per law must be made to avoid  any loss to the exchequer and it will be the personal responsibility of the  institutional head to ensure that such recoveries are effected in full.
2. It is observed  that although the cases and amounts of undue benefits have been identified, the  recovery process is quite slow and banks are yet to refund to Reserve Bank of  India, the amount identified by them. You are therefore, advised to complete  the recovery process by refunding  the  identified amount without any further delay and adjust the amount in the books  of account as and when recovery is effected in cases of the following categories  pointed out by CAG –
Benefits  granted to ineligible borrowers,
Excess  benefits extended to borrowers and
Charges/Interest claimed/ debited.
3. You may speed up  the refund process in pending non-CAG cases also and refund both the amounts to  the Regional Office of Reserve Bank of India concerned, on or before December  20, 2013.
Yours faithfully
(P.K.Arora)
