In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of Section 11 of  Credit Information Companies (Regulation) Act, 2005, and in supersession of its  direction on Investment in Credit Information Companies dated November 20,  2008, Reserve Bank of India, being satisfied that it is necessary and expedient  in the public interest to do so, hereby directs that investments directly or  indirectly by any person, whether resident or otherwise, shall not exceed ten  per cent of the equity capital of the investee company.
2. Notwithstanding the above,  the Reserve Bank may consider allowing higher FDI limits as under to entities  which have an established track record of running a Credit Information Bureau  in a well regulated environment:
up to 49% if their ownership is not well diversified (i.e.,  one or more shareholders each hold more than 10% of voting rights in the  company)
up to 74% if their ownership is well diversified
or
If their ownership is not well diversified, at least 50% of the directors  of the investee CIC in India are Indian nationals/ Non-Resident Indians/  Persons of Indian Origin subject to the condition that one third of the  directors are Indian nationals resident in India.
The investor company should preferably be a listed  company on a recognised stock exchange.
3. In case the investor in a  Credit Information Company in India is a wholly owned subsidiary (directly or  indirectly) of an investment holding company, the conditions as at (a), (b) and  (c) of (2) above will be applied to the operating group company that is engaged  in credit information business and has undertaken to provide technical know-how  to the Credit Information Company in India.
