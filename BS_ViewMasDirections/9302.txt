Notes
:
While    calculating the aggregate of funded and non-funded exposure of a borrower for    the purpose of assignment of risk weight, banks may 'net-off' against the    total outstanding exposure of the borrower –
(a) advances collateralized by cash margins or deposits;
(b)    credit balances in current or other accounts of the borrower which are not    earmarked for specific purposes and free from any lien;
(c    ) in respect of any assets where provisions for depreciation or for bad debts    have been made;
(d)    claims received from DICGC / ECGC and kept in a separate a/c pending    adjustment in case these are not adjusted against the dues outstanding in the    respective a/cs;

B. Off-Balance Sheet Items
The credit risk exposure attached to  off-Balance Sheet items has to be first calculated by multiplying the face  amount of each of the off-Balance Sheet items by 'credit conversion factors' as  indicated in the table below. This will then have to be again multiplied by the  weights attributable to the relevant counter-party as specified above.
Sl. No
Instruments
Credit Conversion Factor (%)
1
Direct    credit substitutes e.g. general guarantees of indebtedness (including stand    L/Cs serving as financial guarantees for loans and securities) and    acceptances (including endorsements with character of acceptance)
100
2
Certain    transaction-related contingent items (e.g. performance bonds, bid bonds,    warranties and standby L/Cs related to particular transactions)
50
3
Short-term    self-liquidating trade-related contingencies (such as documentary credits    collateralized by the underlying shipments)
20
4
Sale    and repurchase agreement and asset sales with recourse, where the credit risk    remains with the bank.
100
5
Forward    asset purchase, forward deposit and partly paid shares and securities, which    represent commitments with certain draw down
100
6
Note issuance    facilities and revolving underwriting facilities
50
7
Other    commitments (e.g., formal standby facilities and credit lines) with an    original maturity of over one year
50
8
Similar    commitments with an original maturity up to one year, or which can be unconditionally    cancelled at any time
0
9
(i)    Guarantees issued by banks against the counter guarantees of other banks
(ii)    Rediscounting of documentary bills accepted by banks (Bills discounted by    banks which have been accepted by another bank will be treated as a funded    claim on a bank)
Note
:
In these    cases, banks  should be fully satisfied    that the risk exposure is, in fact, on the other bank.  Bills purchased / discounted / negotiated under LC    (where the payment to the beneficiary is not made 'under reserve') will be    treated as an exposure on the LC issuing bank and not on the borrower. All    clean negotiations as indicated above, will be assigned the risk weight  normally applicable to inter-bank    exposures, for capital adequacy purposes. In the case of negotiations 'under    reserve' the exposure should be treated as on the borrower and risk weight    assigned accordingly.

Notes :
While    calculating the aggregate of funded and non-funded exposure of a borrower for    the purpose of assignment of risk weight, bank may 'net-off' against the    total outstanding exposure of the borrower credit balances in current or    other accounts which are not earmarked for specific purposes and free from    any lien.
After    applying the conversion factor as indicated above, the adjusted off-balance sheet    value shall again be multiplied by the weight attributable to the relevant    counter-party as specified.
Note :
At present, State and District Central Cooperative Banks may not be undertaking  most of the off-balance sheet transactions. However, keeping in view their  potential for expansion, risk- weights are indicated against various  off-balance sheet items, which, perhaps banks may undertake in future.
