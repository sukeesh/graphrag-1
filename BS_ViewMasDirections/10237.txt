Dear Sir/Madam
Acceptance of cheques bearing a date as per National Calendar (Saka Samvat) for payment
As you are aware that Government of India has accepted Saka Samvat as National Calendar with effect from March 22, 1957 and all Government statutory orders, notifications, Acts of Parliament, etc. bear both the dates i.e., Saka Samvat as well as Gregorian Calendar. Therefore, a cheque written in Hindi and bearing a date in Hindi is a valid instrument.
2. All Co-operative Banks are therefore advised that they should accept cheques bearing a date as per National Calendar (Saka Samvat) for payment, if otherwise found in order. You are further advised to ascertain the Gregorian calendar date corresponding to the National Saka calendar in order to avoid payment of stale cheques.
Yours faithfully
(Suma Varma)
Principal Chief General Manager
