All Authorised Persons in Foreign Exchange
Madam / Dear Sir,
Master Direction – Opening and Maintenance of Rupee/Foreign Currency Vostro Accounts of Non-resident Exchange Houses
Rupee Drawing Arrangement (RDA) is a channel to receive cross-border remittances from overseas jurisdictions. Under this arrangement, the Authorised Category I banks enter into tie-ups with the non-resident Exchange Houses to open and maintain their Vostro Account.
2. Reserve Bank issues directions to Authorised Persons, including Authorised Category I banks, under Section 11 of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, in regard to conduct foreign exchange business in compliance with the provisions of the Act and any rules, regulations, notifications, directions or orders made there under.
3. The directions relating to Opening and Maintenance of Rupee/ Foreign Currency Vostro Accounts of Non-resident Exchange Houses in India are being issued in a consolidated form through the
Master Direction
enclosed herewith. Reporting instructions can be found in Master Direction on Reporting. It may be noted that whenever necessary, Reserve Bank shall issue directions to Authorised Persons through A.P. (DIR Series) Circulars in regard to any change in the rules, regulations, notifications, directions or orders or the manner in which relative transactions are to be conducted by the Authorised Persons with their customers/constituents. The Master Direction issued herewith shall be amended suitably simultaneously.
Yours faithfully,
(Vivek Srivastava)
Chief General Manager
Master Direction - Opening and Maintenance of Rupee/ Foreign Currency Vostro Accounts of Non-resident Exchange Houses
1. Introduction
Cross-border inward remittances may also be received under Rupee Drawing Arrangements (RDAs) through the Rupee Vostro Account of Exchange Houses situated in Gulf countries, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia (for Malaysia only under Speed Remittance Procedure) and all other countries which are FATF compliant (for all other countries which are FATF compliant only under Speed Remittance Procedure).
This document covers the general instructions, permitted transactions and the various types of arrangements under this route. The guidelines for Foreign Currency Drawing Arrangements and other miscellaneous provisions are also covered in the later part of the document.
2. General Instructions
AD Category–I banks should apply to the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve Bank in the prescribed form with necessary documents for the first time they enter into RDAs with non–resident Exchange Houses from Gulf countries, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and all other countries which are FATF compliant, for opening and maintaining in India the Rupee vostro accounts of those non-resident Exchange Houses. Subsequently, they may enter into RDAs, subject to the prescribed guidelines and inform the Reserve Bank immediately. However, once the total number of RDAs reaches twenty, the AD Category-I bank may cause a detailed external audit of their internal system to ensure that it is working satisfactorily. Based on the satisfactory report, the Board of AD Category-I banks may authorize more such arrangements. A copy of the Board Note together with Board Resolution in the matter may be filed with the Reserve Bank and new arrangements informed to the Reserve Bank immediately. Rupee/ foreign currency vostro accounts of non-resident Exchange Houses in India may be opened by the AD Category I banks subject to the following conditions:
(a) While considering the request of an Exchange House for opening an account in India, the AD Category-I banks concerned should make necessary enquiries about the financial standing of the Exchange House, in accordance with the normal banking practices and satisfy themselves fully in all respects. AD Category-I banks should also ensure that the Exchange Houses hold valid licenses issued by the Local Monetary/ Supervisory Authority concerned and have necessary authority / license to transact currency exchange/ money transfer business.
(b) The requirement of registration of the Agreement between the AD Category-I banks and Exchange Houses under the Rupee Drawing Arrangement/ Foreign Currency Drawing Arrangement has been made optional. However, such arrangements should be subjected to comprehensive legal documentation and AD Category-I banks should take care of all necessary legal requirements in this regard. Further, it should be ensured that all the partners of the Exchange Houses are jointly and severally bound to honour the obligations devolving on the Exchange Houses under the agreement.
(c) The normal banking requirements of registration of Power of Attorney/ specimen signatures of signing officials of the Exchange Houses should be observed.
3. Instructions regarding operations in the Rupee vostro accounts
(a) The accounts can be used for channeling cross- border inward remittances into India primarily on private account. The remitter and the beneficiary should be individuals barring a few exceptions. Remittances through Exchange Houses for financing of trade transactions are permitted up to Rs.15,00,000 (Rupees fifteen lakhs only) per transaction.
The accounts should not be used for cross-border outward remittances from India
.
(b) The accounts should run on a credit basis. No overdraft should be granted to the account holders. However, in case of Designated Depository Agency (DDA) procedure, the funds lying in the DDA A/c may be taken into account, if need be. AD Category-I banks shall adopt value dating where on-line debit to Rupee vostro account is not possible on a real time basis when any payment is made at drawee branches, to check adequacy of funds and detect concealed overdrafts. However, in such cases, it may be ensured that the drawee branches are networked at the earliest.
(c) Separate Rupee vostro account shall be maintained for each arrangement. The accounts should be funded by sale of permitted foreign currency to the AD Category-I bank, which maintains the account. Rupee funds transferred from another AD Category-I bank or from another vostro account will not be eligible for credit to the account.
(d) Debits of permitted types of inward remittances [vide item
3(a)
above] may be allowed freely and given the same status as remittances made in foreign exchange in an approved manner to India. Thus, such payments will be eligible for credit to Non-Resident (External) Rupee Accounts maintained by Non-Resident Indians, or for acceptance under priority allotment, etc., schemes. In order to facilitate tourists (whether Indian or not), receiving remittances through such accounts to prove the external sources of the funds wherever required (such as for payment of passages in India or for re-conversion of unutilised balances), AD Category-I banks may issue certificates in the same form as obtaining for inward remittances received through Rupee accounts of overseas banks.
(e) Funds in such accounts will not be convertible, nor will they be transferable to other AD Category-I banks or to other non-resident accounts maintained with the same AD Category-I bank.
For closure of the Vostro accounts and remitting back funds (in foreign currency), if any, under RDA, prior permission of RBI is not required. However, the AD Category I bank may reconcile the accounts before effecting the closure. Further, the AD Category I banks may report the foreign currency outflow in Statement ‘E’.
1
(f) Balances in such accounts will not qualify for payment of interest.
(g) The branch of the AD Category–I bank maintaining the Rupee vostro account of the Exchange House should not credit to the account, rupees purchased by the latter unless confirmation is received to the effect that the nostro account of the AD Category-I bank has been credited with the counter-value in foreign currency (cf. paragraph 3.3.1 of the Guidelines for Internal Control over Foreign Exchange Business, February, 2011).
(h) AD Category-I banks may obtain suitable and adequate collateral either in the form of a cash deposit in any convertible foreign currency or guarantee of a bank of international repute, depending on the type of arrangement to take care of the credit and operational risks.
They may frame their own policy in this regard
2
.
(i) A cap of 300 on the number of drawee branches has been prescribed by the Reserve Bank as a prudential measure. However, AD Category-I banks may designate drawee branches beyond 300, provided such branches are under the Core Banking Solution where on-line monitoring of funds position is ensured to avoid concealed overdrafts in vostro accounts, subject to the terms and conditions of Reserve Bank’s approval for the tie-up with an Exchange House and the instructions pertaining to RDA issued by the Reserve Bank from time to time. The AD Category-I banks should obtain necessary Board approval before increasing the number of drawee branches beyond 300 and should inform the position to the Reserve Bank immediately.
4. Permitted Transactions

5 Types of Rupee Drawing Arrangements and Collateral Cover
Rupee Drawing Arrangements can be conducted under the Designated Depository Agency (DDA), Non-Designated Depository Agency (Non-DDA) and Speed Remittance procedures.
A. Designated Depository Agency (DDA) Procedure
(a) The Exchange House will be required to open a bank account in a convertible foreign currency (known as DDA account) in the name of the drawee bank (a/c - Exchange House) with an international bank acceptable to the drawee bank at a centre mutually agreed upon or with the drawee bank itself at the branch where the corresponding Rupee vostro account is maintained, with the prior approval of the Reserve Bank.
(b) The Exchange House will, at the end of each day, arrive at the total drawings in Indian Rupees for the day and will convert the same into foreign currency which shall be deposited into the account of the drawee bank (a/c-Exchange House) [known as DDA account, as described at 1(a) above] on the next working day before noon.
(c) The Exchange House will send to the drawee bank information about the total number and the aggregate value of drafts drawn and daily deposits in the DDA account. Transfer from the DDA account should be as frequently as possible and is subject to the stipulation as at 1(e) below.
(d) The funds will be held in the DDA account under lien to the drawee bank. The only debits allowed from the DDA account will be (i) on account of transfer to the nostro account of the drawee bank where the DDA account is maintained with a bank other than the drawee bank, (ii) for crediting the Rupee vostro account of the Exchange House by selling permitted foreign currency to the drawee bank where the DDA account is maintained with the drawee bank.
(e) It will be the responsibility of the Exchange House to arrange for the transfer of the sum collected on any particular day to the DDA account. The float period for the funds with DDA account will be decided by the drawee bank in consultation with the Exchange House subject to a maximum of
five days
.
(f) The interest earned on the amount deposited by the Exchange House with the DDA as provided for at 1 (b) above, up to the date of transfer to the nostro account of the drawee bank will accrue to the Exchange House.
(g) To ensure compliance of the above, the drawee bank in India will appoint a firm of practicing Chartered Accountants/ Auditors, operating in the country concerned to examine the daily drawings and deposits in the accounts with the DDA as well as transfer to the nostro account of the drawee bank. For this purpose, the Exchange House will undertake to allow the auditors to inspect the books, pay in vouchers, etc., of the Exchange House in so far as they pertain to Rupee drawing arrangement. Such inspections will be done at least once or twice every week by the auditors.
(h) As an alternative to the appointment of auditors as mentioned in paragraph 1(g) above, the AD Category-I bank may depute a suitable official as their representative to the Exchange House to take up such functions so as to safeguard the interests of the AD Category-I bank.
(i) The auditors / representative will promptly report the findings to the drawee bank. In case of default on the part of the Exchange House, the drawee bank will as per terms and conditions of agreement, terminate the agency arrangement under notice to the Exchange House. The termination will also be promptly reported to the Reserve Bank.
(j) So long as the Exchange House complies with the guidelines, the drawee bank will ensure that the drafts issued are honoured at the branches mutually agreed to.
(k) The remuneration payable to the auditors will be borne by the drawee banks.
(l) Drafts drawn by the Exchange House should have a validity of only
three months
from the date of issue thereof.
(m) AD Category-I banks should satisfy themselves that the books of accounts of Exchange Houses are regularly audited by auditors approved by the local supervisory authorities.
(n) AD Category-I banks should call for periodical credit reports, audited balance sheet and profit and loss account of the Exchange House and other relevant information so as to take a decision regarding continuance of accounts in their books.
(o) Valid copies of all licenses should also be kept on record by the AD Category-I bank.
(p) Since the books of account of the Exchange House cannot be inspected, AD Category-I banks should periodically review the arrangement by paying visits to the Exchange Houses and / or by periodical review of opinion reports. The visits of officials from AD Category-I banks should be at a sufficiently senior level, who are fully conversant with the conduct of the Non-resident Rupee Accounts of the Exchange Houses.
(q) Collateral Cover for DDA: For Exchange Houses which have not completed three years of operation, collateral cover in cash deposit in any convertible foreign currency or guarantee from a bank of international repute equivalent to 7 days’ projected drawings may be obtained. For Exchange Houses which have completed three years of successful operations, no collateral is prescribed. However, AD Category-I banks may secure their position by acquiring adequate collateral cover. Cash deposit in any convertible foreign currency or a guarantee from a bank of international repute equivalent to 15 days’ estimated drawings may be obtained as collateral cover where it is not possible to appoint auditors as mentioned at 1(g) above. The deposit should be in the name of the AD Category-I bank with interest thereon at market related rates payable to the Exchange House placing the deposits. The amount of deposit and guarantee should be periodically reviewed and properly monitored by the AD Category-I banks to ensure that the collateral covers adequately the drawings.
B. Non- DDA procedure
(a) As an alternative to maintaining a DDA account and appointment of auditors as above, the AD Category-I banks may opt for the Non-DDA procedure.
(b) Under Non–DDA procedure, the Exchange House funds their vostro account with the AD Category-I banks by purchasing rupees from the AD Category-I banks against USD for the total of drafts issued by them at periodic intervals and sends weekly statements of drawing and funding to the AD Category-I banks.
(c) Collateral Cover for Non-DDA: For Exchange Houses which have not completed three years of operation, collateral cover in cash deposit in any convertible foreign currency or guarantee from a bank of international repute equivalent to 7 days’ projected drawings may be obtained. For Exchange Houses which have completed three years of successful operations, no collateral is prescribed. Further, under Non-DDA arrangement, a collateral cover in cash deposit in any convertible foreign currency or guarantee from a bank of international repute equivalent to 10 days’ projected drawings may be obtained from Exchange Houses. In addition to the above, if there is a restriction on the bank’s right to depute its own staff for examination of books of the Exchange House, as was in case of Exchange Houses in Kuwait, additional cash deposit in any convertible foreign currency / guarantee from a bank of international repute equivalent to 15 days’ estimated drawings may be obtained. The deposit should be in the name of the AD Category-I bank with interest thereon at market related rates payable to the Exchange House placing the deposits. The amount of deposit and guarantee should be periodically reviewed and properly monitored by the AD Category-I banks to ensure that the collateral adequately covers the drawings and account for the pipeline debits evaluated.
C. Speed Remittance Procedure
(a) AD Category-I banks are permitted to enter into RDA under speed remittance procedure wherein:
(i) The Exchange House sends payment instructions with complete details like name, address, etc., via SWIFT or internet.
7
(ii)
Ordinarily,
the Exchange House
should
fund the Rupee account through the nostro account of the AD Category-I bank in advance before issuing payment instructions
and
on verification of data and availability of balances in the vostro account of the exchange house the AD Category-I bank issues drafts in favour of the beneficiary or credits the account of the beneficiary.
8
(iii) Where facility of speed remittance is extended to existing Rupee drawing arrangements, the Exchange House shall open a separate Rupee account with the prior approval of the Reserve Bank. However, where the operations in the existing Rupee drawing arrangements under DDA/ Non-DDA procedure are satisfactory, AD Category-I banks can extend the facility of speed remittance to the same Exchange House without prior approval of the Reserve Bank, subject to usual terms and conditions and after obtaining all the necessary documents from the Exchange House. However, the Reserve Bank should be informed in the matter immediately.
9
(b)
The AD Category - I banks are free to determine the requirement of collateral, if any, based on factors such as whether the remittances are pre-funded, the track record of the Exchange House, whether the remittances are effected on gross (real-time) or net (file transfer) basis, etc. and may frame their own policy in this regard.
6. Foreign Currency Drawing Arrangements
AD Category-I banks may enter into foreign currency drawing arrangements under DDA or Non-DDA procedure with those Exchange Houses with whom they have Rupee Drawing Arrangements (RDAs), with prior approval of the Reserve Bank, subject to the following conditions.

(h) Collateral cover: Exchange Houses should keep a deposit of not less than USD 50,000 with the drawee AD Category-I bank.
