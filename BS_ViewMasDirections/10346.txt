Please refer to the guidelines contained in the Technical specifications issued by us vide DCM (CC) No. G-18/03.39.01/2008-09 dated November 14, 2008 in respect of construction of new CCs, wherein the banks were advised to maintain Smoke Detection and Fire Alarm System, as also the Fire Fighting System in good working order through service contracts.

The banks may also ensure that the working condition of the Hotline and other security related gadgets, viz. access control, CCTV, etc. are checked once in a fortnight by the CC officials.
