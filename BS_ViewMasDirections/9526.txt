Madam / Dear Sir
Review of norms for classification of Urban  Co-operative Banks (UCBs) as Financially Sound and Well Managed (FSWM)
Please refer to our
circular  UBD.CO.LS (PCB) Cir.No.20/07.01.000/2014-15 dated October 13, 2014
.
2. We have received representations from various  stakeholders requesting us to review the definition of regulatory comfort as prescribed  in para 3 of the circular ibid. The matter has been examined by us and it has  been decided to revise the definition of ‘Regulatory Comfort’. Accordingly, regulatory comfort for the purpose of classification  of an UCB as FSWM would now include compliance to the provisions of  Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS), Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and the  instructions / directions issued by RBI from time to time i.e. the bank should  have track record of regulatory compliance and no monetary penalty should have  been imposed on the bank on account of violation of RBI directives / guidelines  during the last two financial years.
3. The other criteria prescribed for considering  an UCB as FSWM detailed in the circular dated October 13, 2014 remain unchanged.
Yours faithfully,
(Suma Varma)
Principal Chief General Manager
