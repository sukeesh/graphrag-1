Madam/ Dear Sir,
Minimum qualifications and experience for CFO and CTO
Rapid innovations in banking and technology call for better risk governance in the areas of finance and technology. A Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) in banks’ management structure would play a crucial role in strengthening and sustaining the banks’ risk governance framework.
2. It is, therefore, advised that banks, while inviting applications for these positions, stipulate, at a minimum, the qualifications and experience for the CFO and CTO as detailed in
Annex
. Banks may, however, prescribe additional qualifications and experience as they deem fit, taking into account the risk profile, size and scale of operations.
Yours faithfully,
