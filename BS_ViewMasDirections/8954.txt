The Union of India and where needed the State  Government will facilitate the conduct of the investigastions, in their fullest  measures, by the Special Investigation Team and functioning, by extending all  necessary financial, material, legal, diplomatic and intelligence resources,  whether such investigations or portions of such investigations occur inside the  country or abroad.”
