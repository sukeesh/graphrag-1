Dear Sir / Madam,
Gold Loan – Bullet Repayment - UCBs
Please refer to
circular UBD.PCB.Cir.No.22/13.05.000/07-08 dated  November 26, 2007
, wherein Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs)  were permitted to grant gold loans up to
`
1.00 lakh with bullet  repayment option.
2. Based on the representations received from UCBs and National/State Federations,  it has been decided to increase the quantum of loan that could be granted under  the scheme, from
`
1.00 lakh to
`
2.00 lakh subject to the following conditions:
The period of  the loan shall not exceed 12 months from the date of sanction.
Interest will be  charged to the account at monthly rests but will become due for payment along  with principal only at the end of 12 months from the date of sanction.
Banks should  maintain a Loan to Value (LTV) ratio of 75 % on the outstanding amount of loan  including the interest on an ongoing basis, failing which the loan will be  treated as a Non performing Asset (NPA).
The valuation of gold would be as per instructions  contained in para 3 of the
circular UBD.CO.BPD.PCB.Cir.No.60/13.05.001/2013-14 dated May 9,  2014
