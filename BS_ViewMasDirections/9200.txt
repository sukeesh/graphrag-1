Dear Sir/ Madam
Treatment  of accounts opened for credit of  Scholarship
Amounts  under Government Schemes
Please  refer to our
Circular DBOD. No. Leg. BC.53/09.07.005/2013-14 dated September  17, 2013
advising banks to allot a  different “product code” in their CBS to  accounts opened by banks for  beneficiaries under the various Central / State Government Schemes including  scholarship schemes for students so that the stipulation of inoperative  /dormant account due to non-operation does not apply.
2.  Bombay High Court has brought to our notice that banks fix a limit on total  credits in zero balance accounts opened  for students studying in primary,  secondary / higher secondary schools and technical institutions. Resultantly, in cases where scholarship amounts exceed the credit limit, banks do not allow  the credit and return the amount to the  disbursement account of the Government.  Further, in some cases banks are reported  to have closed zero balance  accounts unilaterally without intimating  student beneficiaries concerned.  Instances of banks refusing to open zero  balance account for students have also been brought to our notice.
3.  As directed by the Bombay High Court, banks are hereby advised to ensure that accounts of all  student beneficiaries under the various  Central/State Government Scholarship Schemes are free from restrictions of  ‘minimum balance’ and ‘total credit limit’.
4.  Please acknowledge receipt.
Yours faithfully,
(Sudarshan  Sen)
