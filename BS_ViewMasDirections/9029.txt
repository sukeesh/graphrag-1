(i) Standard assets*;

(iii) Doubtful assets; and
(iv) Loss assets.
* Assets acquired under guarantee obligations  will not be classified as standard assets.
(2) The class of assets  referred to above shall not be upgraded merely as a result of rescheduling,  unless it satisfies the conditions as stipulated by the Bank from time to time,  required for the upgradation.
Provisioning requirements
6. (1)
Provision for losses on invoked guarantees
: A mortgage guarantee company is exposed to a potential loss when its  guarantee is invoked. Mortgage guarantee companies shall hold provisions for  losses in respect of such invoked guarantees pending recovery of assets. The  amount of provisions required to be held shall be equal to the contract-wise  aggregate of 'amount of invocation' after adjusting the realisable value of the  assets held by the company in respect of each housing loan where the guarantee  has been invoked. In case the realisable value of the assets held in respect of  any invoked guarantee is more than the amount of invocation, the excess shall  not be adjusted against the shortfall in other invoked guarantees. In case the  amount of provisions already held is in excess of the amount as computed above,  the excess shall not be reversed. The amount of provisions made each year shall  be shown as a separate line item in the Profit and Loss Account. The amount of  provision held for losses on settlement of invoked guarantees shall be shown as  a separate line item on the liability side of the balance sheet.
(2)
Provision for  'Incurred But-Not-Reported (IBNR) losses
': A mortgage guarantee company is  exposed to a potential loss when there is a default in a housing loan  guaranteed by it. Mortgage guarantee companies shall hold provisions in respect  of such defaulted housing loans where the trigger event is yet to occur or the  guarantee is yet to be invoked. The potential loss to which the guarantee  company is exposed to is referred to as 'Incurred-But-Not-Reported (IBNR)  losses'. The amount of provisions required to be held shall be arrived at on an  actuarial basis depending upon the estimates of loss frequency and loss  severity for incurred but not reported losses which are derived from historic  data, trends, economic factors and other statistical data in relation to paid  claims, the provisions held for claims settled, risk statistics, etc. In case  the amount of provisions already held is in excess of the amount as computed  above, the excess shall not be reversed. The amount of provisions made each  year shall be shown as a separate line item in the Profit and Loss Account. The  amount of provision held for Incurred But-Not-Reported (IBNR) losses shall be  shown as a separate line item on the liability side of the balance sheet.
(3) Subject to what has  been mentioned above, every mortgage guarantee company shall, after taking into  account the time lag between an account becoming non-performing, its  recognition as such, the realisation of the security and the erosion over time  in the value of security charged, make provision against each class as provided  hereunder :-
(4)
Mortgage guarantee assets
The provisioning requirement  in respect of mortgage guarantee assets shall be as under :
(i)
Loss    Assets
The    entire asset shall be written off. If the assets are permitted to remain in    the books for any reason, 100% of the outstanding should be provided for;
(ii)
Doubtful    Assets
(a)
100%    provision to the extent to which the advance is not covered by the realisable    value of the security to which the mortgage guarantee company has a valid    recourse shall be made. The realisable value is to be estimated on a    realistic basis;
(b)
In    regard to the secured portion, provision is to be made on the following basis    to the extent of 20% to 100% of the secured portion depending upon the period    for which the asset has remained doubtful:
Period for which the asset has remained      in doubtful category
% of provision
Up to one year
20
One to three years
30
More than three years
100
(iii)
Sub-standard    assets
A    general provision of 10% of total outstanding shall be made.
For    Standard Assets
Standard    asset
Mortgage    guarantee companies should make general provisions for standard asset on the    following basis;
(a)
Guarantee    cover for residential housing loans beyond Rs.20 lakhs at 1%;
(b)
All    other guarantee cover at 0.40%
Notes    :
(1)
The    provisions on standard asset should not be reckoned for arriving at net NPAs.
(2)
The    provisions towards standard assets need not be netted from gross advances but    shown separately as 'Contingent Provisions against Standard Assets' under    'Other Liabilities and Provisions Others' in the balance sheet.
(3)
It    is clarified that income recognition on and provisioning against NPAs are two    different aspects of prudential norms and provisions as per the norms are    required to be made on NPAs on total outstanding balances. The fact that    income on an NPA has not been recognised cannot be taken as reason for not    making provision.
Other  Activities
7. A mortgage guarantee company can take up any activity  up to 10% of its total assets. If a mortgage guarantee company undertakes any  other business as specified in 45I(c) of the RBI Act 1934 within the permitted  limit, for which Prudential Norms are already prescribed and the same is  contained in
Notification No.DNBS.193DG(VL)-2007 dated February 22, 2007
, as amended from time to time, the said norms  for valuation of investments, asset classification and provisioning should be  followed.
Accounting year
8. Every mortgage guarantee company shall prepare its  balance sheet and profit and loss account as on March 31 every year. Whenever a  mortgage guarantee company intends to extend the date of its balance sheet as  per provisions of the Companies Act, it should take prior approval of the  Reserve Bank of India before approaching the Registrar of Companies for this  purpose.
Further, even in cases  where the Bank and the Registrar of Companies grant extension of time, the  mortgage guarantee company shall furnish to the Bank a proforma balance sheet  (unaudited) as on March 31 of the year and the statutory returns due on the  said date.
Disclosure  in the balance sheet
9. (1) Every mortgage guarantee company shall separately  disclose in its balance sheet the provisions made as per paragraph 6 above  without netting them from the income or against the value of assets.
(2) The provisions shall be  distinctly indicated under separate heads of account separately for mortgage  guarantee business and others and individually for each type of assets as under  :-
(i) provisions for bad and  doubtful debts; and
(ii) provisions for  depreciation in investments.
(3) Such provisions for  each year shall be made from the profit and loss account.

Explanations
:
On balance sheet assets
(1) In these Directions,  degrees of credit risk expressed as percentage weightages have been assigned to  balance sheet assets. Hence, the value of each asset / item requires to be  multiplied by the relevant risk weights to arrive at risk adjusted value of  assets. The aggregate shall be taken into account for reckoning the minimum  capital ratio. The risk weighted asset shall be calculated as the weighted  aggregate of funded items as detailed hereunder :
Items of Assets - On-Balance Sheet Items
Risk Weight % Age
(i)
Cash

(ii)
Bank    balances and claims on banks including fixed deposits and certificates of    deposits.

Notes    :
(1)
Netting    may be done only in respect of assets where provisions for depreciation or    for bad and doubtful debts have been made.
(2)
Assets    which have been deducted from owned fund to arrive at net owned fund shall    have a weightage of 'zero'.
(3)
While    calculating the aggregate of funded exposure of a borrower for the purpose of    assignment of risk weight, mortgage guarantee companies may net off the    amount of cash margin / caution money / security deposits (against which    right to set-off is available) held as collateral against the advances out of    the total outstanding exposure of the borrower.
Off-balance sheet items
(2) In these Directions,  degrees of credit risk exposure attached to off-balance sheet items have been  expressed as percentage of credit conversion factor. Hence, the face value of  each item requires to be first multiplied by the relevant conversion factor to  arrive at credit equivalent value of off-balance sheet item. The credit  equivalent value of each item shall have to be again multiplied by the risk  weight as applicable to the respective counterparties. The aggregate risk  weighted value shall be taken into account for reckoning the minimum capital  ratio. The credit equivalent value of the off-balance sheet items shall be  calculated as per the credit conversion factors for non-funded items as  detailed hereunder :
Nature of Item
Credit Conversion Factor - Percentage
i)
Financial    & other guarantees
100
ii)
Underwriting    obligations in r/o capital investment such as shares / debentures, etc
50
iii)
Partly-paid    shares / debentures
100
iv)
Lease    contracts entered into but yet to be executed
100
v)
Other    contingent liabilities
50
Note    : Cash margins / deposits shall be deducted before applying the conversion    factor.
Loans  against Mortgage Guarantee Company's own shares prohibited
13. (1) No mortgage guarantee company shall lend against  its own shares.
(2) Any outstanding loan  against its own shares shall be recovered by the mortgage guarantee company as  per the repayment schedule before grant of Certificate of Registration to it.
Concentration of credit / investment
14. (1) No mortgage guarantee company shall lend to
(a) any single borrower  exceeding fifteen per cent of its owned fund; and
(b) any single group of  borrowers exceeding twenty five per cent of its owned fund.
(2) Every mortgage  guarantee company shall formulate a policy in respect of exposures to a single  party / a single group of parties.
Notes
:
(1) For determining the  limits, off-balance sheet exposures shall be converted into credit risk by  applying the conversion factors as explained above.
(2) The investments in  debentures for the purposes specified in this paragraph shall be treated as  credit and not investment.
(3) These ceilings shall be  applicable to credit exposure by such a mortgage guarantee company to companies  / firms in its own group as well as to the borrower company's group.
Information  in regard to change of address, directors, auditors, etc. to be submitted
