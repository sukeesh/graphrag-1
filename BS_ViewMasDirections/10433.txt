Implementation of Supreme Court Orders in Writ Petition by Swaraj Abhiyan against Union of India and others- Guidelines on Relief Measures by banks in areas affected by Natural Calamities
During the hearing of the captioned Writ Petition, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has directed the concerned authorities in the Union of India, the State Governments and the Reserve Bank of India and other banks to religiously implement their policies since they are ultimately intended for the benefit of the people of our country and not for the benefit of any stranger.
In view of the above, all the Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs) are advised to ensure implementation of our guidelines on Relief Measures by banks in areas affected by Natural Calamities contained in our
Master Circular dated July 1, 2015
