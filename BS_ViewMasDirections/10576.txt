All Market Participants
Dear Sir/Madam,
Broadcasting of Auction Results and Allotment at Fixed Time
As part of the market borrowing programme of the Government of India (GoI) and State Governments, RBI conducts auction of GoI dated securities, Treasury Bills and State Development loans. The auction results are thereafter put out in public domain.
2. It has been decided to provide greater predictability on timing of declaration of auction results. Consequently, auction results will be published by RBI at a stipulated time as given in the table below. To begin with, this will be introduced for GoI dated securities and T-Bill segments.
Instrument
Announcement time
Treasury Bill
1.30 pm
GoI dated securities
2 pm
3. In case, for any reason, it is not possible to adhere to the above mentioned time line, the auction result will be announced at 2.00 pm for Treasury Bills and 2.30 pm for GoI dated securities, or at half hourly intervals thereafter, should there be further delays. Allotment to the successful bidders will be done as per the existing procedure, immediately after the auction results are announced.
4. This will be implemented with immediate effect.
Yours faithfully,
(A. Mangalagiri)
Chief General Manager
