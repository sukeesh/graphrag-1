A. Products and Operational Guidelines
The product/purpose-wise facilities for persons resident in India (other than AD Category I banks) are detailed under the following subheads:
Contracted Exposure
Probable Exposure
Special Dispensation
1) Contracted Exposures
AD Category I banks have to evidence the underlying documents so that the existence of underlying foreign currency exposure can be clearly established. AD Category I banks, through verification of documentary evidence, should be satisfied about the genuineness of the underlying exposure, irrespective of the transaction being a current or a capital account. Full particulars of the contracts should be marked on the original documents under proper authentication and retained for verification. However, in cases where the submission of original documents is not possible, a copy of the original documents, duly certified by an authorized official of the user, may be obtained. In either of the cases, before offering the contract, the AD Category I banks should obtain an undertaking from the customer and also quarterly certificates from the statutory auditor (for details refer para B (b) for General Instructions). While details of the underlying have to be recorded at the time of booking the contract, in the view of logistic issues, a maximum period of 15 days may be allowed for production of the documents. If the documents are not submitted by the customer within 15 days, the contract may be cancelled, and the exchange gain, if any, should not be passed on to the customer. In the event of non-submission of the documents by the customer within 15 days on more than three occasions in a financial year, booking of permissible derivative contracts in future may be allowed only against production of the underlying documents, at the time of booking the contract.

In addition to the guidelines under the specific foreign exchange derivative product, the general instructions should be followed scrupulously by the users (residents in India other than AD Category I banks) and the market makers (AD Category I banks).
a) In case of all forex derivative transactions [except INR- foreign currency swaps i.e. moving from INR liability to foreign currency liability as in section B para I(1)(iv)] is undertaken, AD Category I banks must take a declaration from the clients that the exposure is unhedged and has not been hedged with another AD Category I bank.

contracted exposure
, AD Category I banks must obtain:
i) An undertaking from the customer that the same underlying exposure has not been covered with any other AD Category I bank/s. Where hedging of the same exposure is undertaken in parts, with more than one AD Category I bank, the details of amounts already booked with other AD Category I bank/s should be clearly indicated in the declaration. This undertaking can also be obtained as a part of the deal confirmation.
ii) An annual certificate from the statutory auditors to the effect that the contracts outstanding with all AD category I banks at any time during the year did not exceed the value of the underlying exposures at that time. It is reiterated, however, that that the AD bank, while entering into any derivative transaction with a client, shall have to obtain an undertaking from the client to the effect that the contracted exposure against which the derivative transaction is being booked has not been used for any derivative transaction with any other AD bank.

d) In any derivative contract, the notional amount should not exceed the actual underlying exposure at any point in time. Similarly, the tenor of the derivative contracts should not exceed the tenor of the underlying exposure. The notional amount for the entire transaction over its complete tenor must be calculated and the underlying exposure being hedged must be commensurate with the notional amount of the derivative contract.
e) Only one hedge transaction can be booked against a particular exposure/ part thereof for a given time period.
f) The term sheet for the derivative transactions (except forward contracts) should also necessarily and clearly mention the following:
the purpose for the transaction detailing how the product and each of its components help the client in hedging;
the spot rate prevailing at the time of executing the transaction; and

Non-resident exporter / importer dealing through their overseas bank (including overseas branches of AD banks in India)
Non-resident exporter / importer approaches his banker overseas with appropriate documents with a request for hedging their Rupee exposure arising out of a confirmed import or export order invoiced in Rupees.
The overseas bank in turn approaches its correspondent in India (i.e. the AD bank in India) for a price to hedge the exposure of its customer along with documentation furnished by the customer that will enable the AD bank in India to satisfy itself that there is an underlying trade transaction (scanned copies would be acceptable). The following undertakings also need to be taken from the customer:
That the same underlying exposure has not been hedged with any other AD Category I bank/s in India.
If the underlying exposure is cancelled, the customer will cancel the hedge contract immediately.
A certification on the end client KYC may also be taken as a one time document from the overseas bank by the AD bank in India.
The AD bank in India based on documents received from the overseas correspondent should satisfy itself about the existence of the underlying trade transaction and offer a forward price (no two-way quotes should be given) to the overseas bank who, in turn, will offer the same to its customer. The AD bank, therefore, will ‘not be’ dealing directly with the overseas importer / exporter.
The amount and tenor of the hedge should not exceed that of the underlying transaction and should be in consonance with the extant regulations regarding tenor of payment / realization of the proceeds.
On due date, settlement is to be done through the correspondent bank’s Vostro or the AD bank’s Nostro accounts.

Model II
Non-resident exporter / importer dealing directly with the AD bank in India
The overseas exporter / importer approaches the AD bank in India with a request for forward cover in respect of underlying transaction for which he furnishes appropriate documentation (scanned copies would be acceptable), on a pre-deal basis to enable the AD bank in India to satisfy itself that there is an underlying trade transaction, and details of his overseas banker, address etc. The following undertakings also need to be taken from the customer
That the same underlying exposure has not been hedged with any other AD Category I bank/s in India.
If the underlying exposure is cancelled, the customer will cancel the hedge contract immediately.

Annex XVIII
. The format can be obtained through the overseas correspondent / bank through SWIFT authenticated message. In case the AD bank has a presence outside India, the AD may take care of the KYC/AML through its bank’s offshore branch.

The amount and tenor of the hedge should not exceed that of the underlying transaction and should be in consonance with the extant regulations regarding tenor of payment / realization of the proceeds.
On due date, settlement is to be done through the correspondent bank’s Vostro or the AD bank’s Nostro accounts. AD banks in India may release funds to the beneficiaries only after sighting funds in Nostro / Vostro accounts.

ii) To hedge Initial Public Offers (IPO) related transient capital flows under the Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA) mechanism.
Products
Forward foreign exchange contracts with rupee as one of the currencies and foreign currency-INR options. Foreign Currency – INR swaps for IPO related flows.
Operational Guidelines, Terms and Conditions
QFIs are allowed to hedge the currency risk on account of their permissible investments with the AD Category-I bank with whom they are maintaining the Rupee Account opened for the purpose of investment.
The eligibility for cover may be determined on the basis of the declaration of the QFI with periodic review undertaken by the AD Category I bank based on the investment value as provided / certified by QDP of the QFI at least at quarterly intervals, on the basis of market price movements, fresh inflows, amounts repatriated and other relevant parameters to ensure that the forward cover outstanding is supported by underlying exposures.
If a hedge becomes naked in part or in full owing to contraction of the market value of the portfolio, for reasons other than sale of securities, the hedge may be allowed to continue till the original maturity, if so desired.
Forward contracts booked by QFIs, once cancelled, can be rebooked up to the extent of 10 per cent of the value of the contracts cancelled. The forward contracts booked may, however, be rolled over on or before maturity.
The cost of hedge should be met out of repatriable funds and /or inward remittance through normal banking channel.
All outward remittances incidental to the hedge are net of applicable taxes.
For IPO related transient capital flows
QFIs can undertake foreign currency- rupee swaps only for hedging the flows relating to the IPO under the ASBA mechanism.
The amount of the swap should not exceed the amount proposed to be invested in the IPO.
The tenor of the swap should not exceed 30 days.
The contracts, once cancelled, cannot be rebooked. Rollovers under this scheme will also not be permitted.
Operational Guidelines, Terms and Conditions
The operational guidelines as outlined for FIIs would be applicable, with the exception of the provision relating to rebooking of cancelled contracts.  All foreign exchange derivative contracts permissible for a resident outside India other than a FII, once cancelled, are not eligible to be rebooked.

Annex I
[See Part C, Paragraph 2]
A. Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Exposure Limits of Authorised Dealers Category – I
The Foreign Exchange Exposure Limits of Authorised Dealers would be dual in nature.
Net Overnight Open Position Limit (NOOPL) for calculation of capital charge on forex risk.
Limit for positions involving Rupee as one of the currencies (NOP-INR) for exchange rate management.
For banks incorporated in India, the exposure limits fixed by the Board should be the aggregate for all branches including their overseas branches and Off-shore Banking Units. For foreign banks, the limits will cover only their branches in India.
i. Net Overnight Open Position Limit (NOOPL) for calculation of capital charge on forex risk
NOOPL may be fixed by the boards of the respective banks and communicated to the Reserve Bank immediately. However, such limits should not exceed 25 percent of the total capital (Tier I and Tier II capital) of the bank.
The Net Open position may be calculated as per the method given below:
1. Calculation of the Net Open Position in a Single Currency
The open position must first be measured separately for each foreign currency. The open position in a currency is the sum of (a) the net spot position, (b) the net forward position and (c) the net options position.
a) Net Spot Position
The net spot position is the difference between foreign currency assets and the liabilities in the balance sheet. This should include all accrued income/expenses.
b) Net Forward Position
This represents the net of all amounts to be received less all amounts to be paid in the future as a result of foreign exchange transactions which have been concluded. These transactions, which are recorded as off-balance sheet items in the bank's books, would include:
spot transactions which are not yet settled;
forward transactions;
Guarantees and similar commitments denominated in foreign currencies which are certain to be called;
Net future income/expenses not yet accrued but already fully hedged (at the discretion of the reporting bank);
Net of amounts to be received/paid in respect of currency futures, and the principal on currency futures/swaps.
c) Net Options Position
The options position is the "delta-equivalent" spot currency position as reflected in the authorized dealer's options risk management system, and includes any delta hedges in place which have not already been included under 1(a) or 1(b) (i) and (ii) above.
2. Calculation of the Overall Net Open Position
This involves measurement of risks inherent in a bank's mix of long and short position in different currencies. It has been decided to adopt the "shorthand method" which is accepted internationally for arriving at the overall net open position. Banks may, therefore, calculate the overall net open position as follows:
i. Calculate the net open position in each currency (paragraph 1 above).
ii. Calculate the net open position in gold.
iii. Convert the net position in various currencies and gold into Rupees in terms of existing RBI / FEDAI Guidelines. All derivative transactions including forward exchange contracts should be reported on the basis of Present Value (PV) adjustment.
iv. Arrive at the sum of all the net short positions.
v. Arrive at the sum of all the net long positions.
Overall net foreign exchange position is the higher of (iv) or (v). The overall net foreign exchange position arrived at as above must be kept within the limit approved by the bank’s Board.
Note:
Authorised Dealer banks should report all derivative transactions including forward exchange contracts on the basis of PV adjustment for the purpose of calculation of the net open position. Authorised Dealer banks may select their own yield curve for the purpose of PV adjustments. The banks however should have an internal policy approved by its ALCO regarding the yield curve/(s) to be used and apply it on a consistent basis.
3. Offshore exposures
For banks with overseas presence, the offshore exposures should be calculated on a standalone basis as per the above method and should not be netted with onshore exposures. The aggregate limit (on-shore + off-shore) may be termed Net Overnight open Position (NOOP) and will be subjected to capital charge. Accumulated surplus of foreign branches need not be reckoned for calculation of open position. An illustrative example is as follows:
If a bank has, let us say three foreign branches and the three branches have open position as below-
Branch A: + Rs 15 crores
Branch B: + Rs 5 crores
Branch C: - Rs 12 crores
The open position for the overseas branches taken together would be Rs 20 crores.
4. Capital
3
Requirement
As prescribed by the Reserve Bank from time to time
5. Other Guidelines
i. ALCO / Internal Audit Committee of the Authorized Dealers should monitor the utilization of and adherence to the limits.
ii. Authorized Dealers should also have a system in place to demonstrate, whenever required, the various components of the NOOP as prescribed in the guidelines for verification by Reserve Bank.
iii. Transactions undertaken by Authorized Dealers till the end of business day may be computed for calculation of Foreign Exchange Exposure Limits. The transactions undertaken after the end of business day may be taken into the positions for the next day. The end of day time may be approved by the bank’s Board.
ii. Limit for positions involving Rupee as one of the currencies (NOP-INR) for exchange rate management
NOP-INR may be prescribed to Authorised Dealers at the discretion of the Reserve Bank of India depending on the market conditions.
The NOP-INR positions may be calculated by netting off the long & short onshore positions (as arrived at by the short hand method) plus the net INR positions of offshore branches.
Positions undertaken by banks in currency futures / options traded in exchanges will form part of the NOP-INR.
As regards option position, any excesses on account of large option Greeks during volatile market closing / revaluations may be treated as technical breaches. However, such breaches are to be monitored by the banks with proper audit trail. Such breaches should also be regularized and ratified by appropriate authorities (ALCO / Internal Audit Committee).
B. Aggregate Gap Limits (AGL)
i. AGL may be fixed by the boards of the respective banks and communicated to the Reserve Bank immediately. However, such limits should not exceed 6 times the total capital (Tier I and Tier II capital) of the bank.
ii. However, Authorised Dealers which have instituted superior measures such as tenor wise PV01 limits and VaR to aggregate foreign exchange gap risks are allowed to fix their own PV01 and VaR limits based on their capital, risk bearing capacity etc. in place of AGL and communicate the same to the Reserve Bank. The procedure and calculation of the limit should be clearly documented as an internal policy and strictly adhered to.
