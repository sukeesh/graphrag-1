Dear Sirs,
Submission of Data to Credit Information Companies - Format of Data to be submitted by Credit Institutions
Please refer to the
circular number DNBS.(PD).CC.No.200/03.10.001/2010-11 dated September 17, 2010
on the captioned subject in terms of which NBFCs were required to provide current and historical data on borrowers to the Credit Information Companies. The Bank has received representations on the applicability or otherwise of the instructions to NBFCs that do not have any customer interface.
2. On a review it has been decided that NBFCs which are registered with the Bank as Core Investment Companies, Primary Dealers and those purely into investment activities without any customer interface are exempt from the applicability of the above mentioned circular.
Yours faithfully,
(A. Mangalagiri)
