Accordingly, a new sub-para no.8.6 is being added in the Master Direction on Compounding.
II. Public disclosure of guidelines on the amount imposed during compounding
As per provisions of section 13 of FEMA the amount imposed can be up to three times the amount involved in the contravention. However, the amount imposed is calculated based on guidance note given in the
Annex
. Now it has been decided to put the guidance note on the Bank’s website for information of general public. It may, however, be noted that the guidance note is meant only for the purpose of broadly indicating the basis on which the amount to be imposed is derived by the compounding authorities in Reserve Bank of India. The actual amount imposed may sometimes vary, depending on the circumstances of the case taking into account the factors indicated in paragraph 7.3 of the abovementioned Master Direction. This new provision is being inserted as sub-para 7.4 in the Master Direction on Compounding and the subsequent sub-paragraph renumbered accordingly.
