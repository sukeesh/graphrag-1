Dear Sir / Madam,
SHG-Bank Linkage Programme – Revision of progress reports
In terms of our
Circular RPCD.CO.MFFI.BC.No.103/12.01.01/2006-07 dated June 20, 2007
on Microfinance – Submission of progress report and
Master Circular RPCD.FID.BC.No.06/12.01.033/2014-15 dated July 01, 2014
on SHG Bank Linkage Programme, banks have been submitting progress report in the format specified to NABARD on a half yearly basis as on 30 September and 31 March every year.
2. Keeping in view the recent developments, it has been decided to revise the reporting format with a view to capture data pertaining to financing of SHGs under ‘National Rural Livelihood Mission’ (NRLM) and ‘National Urban Livelihoods Mission’ (NULM) separately. Accordingly, the progress under SHG Bank Linkage may be reported state-wise in the enclosed revised format directly to the Micro Credit Innovations Department of NABARD, on half yearly basis. The first such progress report as on 31 March 2015 in the
revised format
may be sent to NABARD not later than June 30, 2015 and subsequent half year return within 30 days from the due date.
3. In addition to hard copy, a soft copy of the progress report in excel format may be sent by
email
to NABARD.
4. Please acknowledge receipt.
Yours faithfully
(A. Udgata)
Principal Chief General Manager
