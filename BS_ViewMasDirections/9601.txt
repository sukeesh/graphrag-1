Dear Sir
Refund of overpayment of pension to the Government Account – Recovery of excess/ wrong pension payments made to the pensioners
Please refer to our circular DGBA.GAD.No.H-10450/45.03.001/2008-09 dated June 1, 2009 on the above subject advising that whenever any excess payment of government pension is detected, the entire amount should be credited to the government account immediately.
2. It is hereby clarified that the above instructions contained therein presume an act of omission on the part of the agency bank. On the other hand, if the agency bank is of the view that the excess/wrong payment to the pensioner is due to errors committed by the government, they may take up the matter with full particulars of the cases with respective Government Department for a quick resolution of the matter. However, this must be a time bound exercise, and the government authority’s acknowledgement to this effect must be kept on the bank’s record. The banks may take up such cases with government departments without reference to the Reserve Bank of India.
3. In all other cases, where the excess payment has arisen on account of mistakes committed by the bank, the amount paid in excess should be credited back to government account in lump sum immediately, as advised in the circular referred to above.
Yours faithfully
(Monisha Chakraborty)
General Manager
