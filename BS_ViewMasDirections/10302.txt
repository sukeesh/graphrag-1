NEFT – Customer Service and Charges – Adherence to Procedural Guidelines and Circulars
We invite reference to
Para 7 of circular DPSS.CO.EPPD No.1583/04.03.01/2013-14 dated January 21, 2014
on the captioned subject wherein banks were advised to submit data pertaining to NEFT transactions by walk-in customers (those not having an account with the bank) in a prescribed format on a quarterly basis starting from quarter ended March 31, 2014.
2. It has been decided to discontinue the submission of this report by member banks, from the quarter ending March 31, 2016. However, member banks may note that as and when required, the Reserve Bank may call for adhoc reports regarding the data for NEFT transactions by walk-in customers (those not having an account with the bank). Hence, banks may continue to maintain such data at their end.
Yours faithfully,
(Nanda S. Dave)
Chief General Manager
