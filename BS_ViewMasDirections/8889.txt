Opening of Bank Accounts in the Names of
Minors with Mothers as Guardians
Please refer to our
circular DBOD.No.Leg.BC.158/C.90(H)-76 dated 29  December, 1976
, inter alia, advising banks to allow opening of minorsâ€™ accounts  (fixed and savings only) with mothers as guardians. We have now examined a  request to extend the facility of allowing opening of minors' accounts with  mothers as guardians, to Recurring Deposit Accounts also and we see no  objection to accede to it. You may advise your branches suitably.
Yours faithfully,
(M.V. Ramamurthy)
