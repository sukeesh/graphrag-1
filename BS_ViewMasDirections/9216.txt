2. The above returns are required to be  submitted in XBRL platform. Submission of XBRL returns assume generation of  required instance documents (XML files) from source data. It is therefore  emphasized that banks may take necessary steps to fine tune their systems, controls  and MIS to generate the required instance documents from own data source.  However, as a temporary measure, excel based installers will also be made  available for compilation and generation of instance documents for banks which  are not ready to create instance documents on their own. Separate communication  will be issued as and when the XBRL site and installers are ready for submitting  the returns. However, banks are advised to compile and keep the data ready for  September 2014 onwards, for submission at short notice.
3. It  is reiterated that the returns are being called for in exercise of powers under  section 27(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and failure to adhere to  instructions on timely submission and data integrity may invite penal provisions  of the Act.
Yours  faithfully,
(Indrani Banerjee)
