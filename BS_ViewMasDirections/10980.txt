2. Further, although a new district “
Lower Siang
” has been published in the above mentioned Gazette Notification, the boundary and administrative units of the district has not been finalized yet and hence, the district is non-functional as per the communication received from the Government of Arunachal Pradesh. Lead bank responsibility will hence be assigned separately for this district.
3. The District Working Code of the new districts have been allotted for the purpose of BSR reporting by banks.
4. There is no change in the lead bank responsibilities of the other districts in the State of Arunachal Pradesh.
Yours faithfully
(Ajay Kumar Misra)
Chief General Manager
