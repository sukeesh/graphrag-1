The  Chairman
All Regional Rural Banks (RRBs)
All  State and Central Co-operative Banks (StCBs and CCBs)
Dear Sir,
Know Your Customer (KYC)/Anti Money  Laundering (AML) Standards/Combating Financing of Terrorism (CFT)/ Obligation  of banks under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 ‘At par’ cheque  facility extended to Cooperative Banks / Regional Rural Banks by Scheduled  Commercial Banks
It has been observed that some banks are  utilizing ‘at par’ cheque facility extended by Scheduled Commercial Banks not  only for their own use but also for their customers, including walk-in  customers for facilitating their remittances and payments.
2. Keeping in view the systemic and  supervisory concerns that emanate from such an arrangement, RRBs/StCBs/CCBs are  advised to utilize the ‘at par’ cheque facility only for:
i) their own use,
ii) their account holders who are KYC  compliant provided that all transactions of
`
50,000.00  or more should be strictly by debit to the customer’s account,
iii) walk-in customers against cash for less  than
`
50,000.00 per individual.
3. In order to utilise the ‘at par’ cheque  facility in the above manner, RRBs/ StCBs/ CCBs should maintain
i) records pertaining to issuance of ‘at par’  cheques covering inter alia applicant’s name and account number, beneficiary’s  details and date of issuance of the ‘at par’ cheque.
ii) sufficient balances/drawing arrangements  with the commercial bank extending such facility for purpose of honouring such  instruments.
RRBs/StCBs/CCBs should also ensure that all  ‘at par’ cheques issued by them are crossed ‘account payee’ irrespective of the  amount involved.
4. RRBs/StCBs/CCBs are advised to make use of  more efficient means of remittances for the customers like NEFT or RTGS by  providing such services directly or by becoming sub-members of banks providing  such services as per regulations in this regard issued by RBI from time to  time.
Yours faithfully,
(A.G.  Ray)
