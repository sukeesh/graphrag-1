Dear Sir/Madam,
Standing Liquidity Facilities for
Banks and Primary Dealers
Please  refer to the
Statement  by Dr. Raghuram G Rajan, Governor on Monetary Policy dated March 4, 2015
, in  terms of which the repo rate under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) has been  reduced by 25 basis points from 7.75 per cent to 7.50 per cent with immediate  effect.
2. Accordingly, the Standing Liquidity  Facilities provided to Primary Dealers (PDs) (collateralised liquidity support)  from the Reserve Bank would be available at the revised repo rate,
i.e.,
at  7.50 per cent with effect from March 4, 2015.
3. As per the
circular No. MPD.BC. 376/07.01.279/2014-15 dated February 3, 2015
, the Export  Credit Refinance (ECR) facility was merged with the system level liquidity  provision with effect from February 7, 2015, but refinancing availed up to  February 6, 2015 may continue till its maturity. In consonance with the reduced  LAF repo rate, the interest rate applicable to outstanding ECR will be at the  revised rate of 7.50 per cent with effect from March 4, 2015.
Yours faithfully,
