Madam / Dear Sir,
Online  Trading Facility to Demat Account Holders - UCBs
We have received requests from Indian Banksâ€™  Association and Cooperative Federations to allow UCBs to provide online trading  facility to their Demat Account holders.

.
The matter has been examined by us. However, considering  the high risk involved in such services, it has been  decided to allow only Scheduled Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks, with  prior approval of the Reserve Bank, to provide online trading facility to their demat  account holders by entering into a tie-up with a broking entity subject to fulfilling the following criteria:
(i) Assessed networth of such UCBs  should not be less than Rs 500 crore as per last inspection.
(ii) UCBs are Financially Sound and Well Managed,  as per criteria prescribed in our
circular  UBD.CO.LS.(PCB).Cir.No.24/07.01.000/2013-14 dated October 1, 2013
.
(iii) UCBs should be registered with SEBI as  Depository Participants.
(iv) UCBs should have implemented Core Banking  Solutions (CBS) fully and are offering Internet Banking services to their  customers.
3. For obtaining regulatory  approval, UCBs, fulfilling the above criteria, may submit their  applications to the Reserve Bank with a copy of Board  Resolution to the effect that they would not be offering tips/ recommendations  to their customers for on-line trading and would also not be undertaking  portfolio management services.
Yours faithfully,
