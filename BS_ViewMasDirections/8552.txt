Madam/Dear Sir,
Investment portfolio  of Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs)
Classification,  Valuation and Provisioning
Please refer to our
circular  UBD.No.PCB.Cir.16/16.20.00/2004-05 dated September 2, 2004
, in terms of  which Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) were advised that the limit of 25 per cent of total  investments under Held to Maturity (HTM) category may be exceeded provided the  excess comprised only Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) securities and the total  SLR securities held in the HTM category is not more than 25 per cent of their  NDTL as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight.
2.  It has been observed that the recent hardening of long term yields has resulted  in banks incurring large mark-to-market (MTM) losses in their investment  portfolio. Since these MTM losses are partly resulting from abnormal market  conditions and could be recouped going forward, it has been decided to provide  the following prudential adjustments -
As per extant instructions, UCBs may shift  investments to HTM with the approval of the Board of Directors once a year and  such shifting will normally be allowed at the beginning of the accounting year.  As a one-time measure, it has now been decided to permit UCBs  to transfer SLR securities from Available For Sale (AFS)/ Held for Trading (HFT)  to HTM category up to the limit of 25 per cent of NDTL. Such transfer of  securities from AFS/HFT category to HTM category should be made at the lower of  acquisition cost or book value or market value. UCBs have the option of valuing  these securities for the purpose of such transfer as at the close of business  of July 15, 2013 and depreciation, if any, should be provided for in accordance  with paragraph 16.5.4 of the
Master Circular No.  UBD.BPD.(PCB).MC.No.12/16.20.000/2013-14 dated July 1, 2013
on Investments by  Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks. If banks  choose to transfer securities as above, the transfers must be done at the  earliest but not later than November 15, 2013. This transfer must be out of the  outstanding position of AFS/HFT securities as at the close of business of November  1, 2013 up to the limit of 25 per cent of NDTL (i.e. NDTL as on October 4, 2013  applicable for maintenance of SLR for November 1, 2013).
UCBs  are required to periodically value their AFS and HFT portfolio and provide for  net depreciation in accordance with paragraphs 17.1.2 and 17.1.3 of the Master  Circular dated July 1, 2013 mentioned above. As a one-time measure, it has been  decided to permit UCBs to distribute the net depreciation of the AFS/HFT  portfolio on each of the valuation dates in the current financial year in equal  instalments during the financial year 2013-14.
Yours  faithfully,
(A.K.Bera)
Principal  Chief General Manager
