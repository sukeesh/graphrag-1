Dear Sir /Madam
Withdrawal of all old  series of Banknotes issued prior to 2005
As you are aware, RBI has  been following a policy of phasing out of certain series of banknotes from time  to time. It has now been decided that all old series of banknotes issued prior  to 2005 will be completely withdrawn from circulation.
2. Accordingly, the following plan of action has  been formulated:
(i) All older series of banknotes issued prior to  2005 would be acceptable for all kinds of monetary transactions only till March  31, 2014.
(ii) Thereafter, the public will be required to  approach bank branches which would provide them exchange facilities on an  ongoing basis.
(iii) These notes will continue to be legal  tender.
(iv) From July 01, 2014, to exchange more than 10  pieces of
`
500 and
`
1000 notes, bank branches should obtain from  non-customers, proof of their identity and residence.
(v) A public  notification informing public of the exercise and soliciting their co-operation  and enabling them to identify the older series is issued separately. A copy of  the same is enclosed for ready reference.
3. Please issue suitable instructions to all  your branches, to provide exchange facilities to members of public and to stop  re-issue of the older series banknotes issued prior to 2005. Notes of such  series tendered over the counters may be sorted immediately and deposited in  the currency chests under the Linkage Scheme or forwarded to the nearest Issue  Office of Reserve Bank of India  for disposal.
4. Please also advise your branches to extend  all cooperation to the members of public so that the withdrawal is carried out  in a smooth and non-disruptive manner, without any inconvenience to the public.
Please acknowledge receipt.
Yours faithfully
