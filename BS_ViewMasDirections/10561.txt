Madam/Dear Sir
Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna-Non-feeding of data by bank branches in the Crop Insurance Portal of MoA&FW.
Please refer to our
circular FIDD.No.FSD.BC20/05.10.007/2015-16 dated March 17, 2016
advising you to ensure strict compliance of the provisions of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna and ensure coverage of 100% of defined loanee farmers along with good number of non-loanee farmers to achieve the defined objectives and targets fixed under the Scheme.
2. As per the PMFBY operational guidelines of the Government of India banks are also expected to capture all relevant data including land and crop details of all loanee farmers and non-loanee farmers availing crop insurance through the branches.
3. Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare has since advised all banks to enter farmer details in the unified portal for crop insurance which is available at
www.agri-insurance.gov.in
. It has been brought to our notice that entries are not being made by the bank branches in the portal. Resultantly MoA&FW, State Governments etc. are not able to cull out any data leading to difficulties in assessment of coverage of crops insured, premiums deducted, etc. You are therefore advised to issue necessary instructions to your branches to feed the relevant data in the portal at the earliest.
Yours faithfully
(Uma Shankar)
Chief General Manager
