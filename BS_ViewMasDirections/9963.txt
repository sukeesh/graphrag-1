Madam / Dear Sir
Extending Value Added Services through ATMs by Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks (UCBs)
Please refer to para 2 of our circular ref: UBD.No.BPT.SUB.9/09.69.00/2000-01 dated June 11, 2001 indicating the functional facilities that were permitted to be offered at the off-site ATMs. The matter has been reviewed and it has been decided that UCBs will now be permitted to offer services that can be offered via a standardized ATM machine like bill payments, account transfers etc. at their on-site / off-site / mobile ATMs as per
Annex
.
2. The UCBs may however ensure that there are enough technological safeguards in place for ensuring data security. Further, as per extant instructions, the products of other financial institutions will not be allowed to be marketed through ATMs.
Yours faithfully,
(P. K. Arora)
Chief General Manager
