Madam / Sir,

Attention of Authorized Dealers Category – I  (AD Category – I) banks is invited to the Foreign  Exchange Management (Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts) Regulations, 2000  dated May 3, 2000 (

in terms of which only persons resident in India  shall participate in the currency futures and exchange traded currency options  market in India subject to the terms and conditions mentioned in the  aforementioned notifications and guidelines, ibid.
2. It has now been decided to allow foreign  portfolio investors (FPIs) eligible to invest in securities as laid down in  Schedules 2, 5, 7 and 8 of the Foreign Exchange Management  (Transfer or Issue of Security by a person resident outside India) Regulations,  2000 (
FEMA  20/2000-RB dated May 3, 2000
(GSR 406 (E) dated May 3, 2000)) as amended  from time to time to enter into currency futures or exchange traded currency  options contracts subject to the following terms and conditions:
FPIs  will be allowed access to the currency futures or exchange traded currency  options for the purpose of hedging the currency risk arising out of the market  value of their exposure to Indian debt and equity securities.
Such  investors can participate in the currency futures / exchange  traded options market through any registered /  recognised trading member of the exchange concerned.
FPIs  can take position – both long( bought) as well as short(sold) – in foreign  currency up to USD 10 million or equivalent per exchange without having to  establish existence of any underlying exposure. The limit will be both day-end  as well as intra-day.
An  FPI cannot take a short position beyond USD 10 million at any time and to take  a long position beyond USD 10 million in any exchange, it will be required to  have an underlying exposure. The onus of ensuring the existence of an  underlying exposure shall rest with the FPI concerned.
The  exchange will, however, be free to impose additional restrictions as prescribed  by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for the purpose of risk  management and fair trading.
The  exchange/ clearing corporation will provide FPI wise information on day-end  open position as well as intra-day highest position to the respective custodian  banks. The custodian banks will aggregate the position of each FPI on the  exchanges as well as the OTC contracts booked with them (i.e. the custodian  banks) and other AD banks. If the total value of the contracts exceeds the  market value of the holdings on any day, the concerned FPI shall be liable to  such penal action as may be laid down by the SEBI in this regard and action as  may be taken by Reserve Bank of India under the Foreign Exchange Management Act  (FEMA), 1999. The designated custodian  bank will be required to monitor this and bring transgressions, if any, to the  notice of RBI / SEBI.
