Dear Sir,
Basel  III Framework on Liquidity Standards – Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Liquidity  Risk Monitoring Tools and LCR Disclosure Standards
Please  refer to the ‘
First Bi-monthly Monetary  Policy Statement, 2014-15
’ announced on April 1, 2014, wherein it was proposed  to issue guidelines relating to Basel III LCR and  Liquidity Risk Monitoring tools by end-May 2014 as the  liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) stipulated by the Basel Committee becomes a  standard with effect from January 1, 2015.
2. It may be recalled that based  on the documents, ‘Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and  Supervision’ as well as ‘Basel III : International Framework for Liquidity Risk  Measurement, Standards and Monitoring’ published by the Basel Committee on  Banking Supervision (BCBS) in September 2008 and December 2010 respectively,  the Reserve Bank had placed the
Draft Guidelines
on Liquidity Risk Management and Basel III Framework on Liquidity Standards on  its website in February 2012 for comments and feedback. Taking into account the  comments and feedback received, the guidelines on ‘Liquidity Risk Management by  Banks’ were issued vide
circular DBOD.BP.No.56/21.04.098/2012-13  dated November 7, 2012
. It was mentioned therein that as the Basel  III liquidity standards were at that time subject to an observation period /  revision by the BCBS with a view to addressing any unintended consequences that  the standard might have for financial markets, credit extension and economic  growth, the final guidelines on Basel III liquidity framework would be issued  once the BCBS revises the framework.
3. The BCBS has since published ‘Basel III:  The Liquidity Coverage Ratio and liquidity risk monitoring tools’ in January  2013. Further, the ‘Liquidity Coverage Ratio Disclosure Standards’ have been  published by the BCBS in January 2014. Accordingly, the final guidelines on the  LCR, Liquidity Risk Monitoring Tools and LCR Disclosure Standards are enclosed  in the
Annex
. The LCR will be introduced in a phased manner starting with a  minimum requirement of 60% from January 1, 2015 and reaching minimum 100% on  January 1, 2019.
Yours faithfully,
(Sudarshan Sen)
