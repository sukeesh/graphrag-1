Dear Sir / Madam
Differential Rate of  Interest for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs)
A reference is invited to
part ‘B’  of the First  Bi-monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2014-15 announced on April 1, 2014
wherein certain measures have been proposed to be adopted by banks in order to  give a fillip to the flow of credit to micro and small enterprises (MSEs)  borrowers.
2. In this regard we advise  that while pricing their loans to MSE borrowers, banks should take into account  the incentives available to them in the form of the credit guarantee cover of  the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) and  the zero risk weight for capital adequacy purpose for the portion of the loan  guaranteed by the CGTMSE and provide differential interest rate for such MSE  borrowers, than the other borrowers. However, banks should note that such  differential rate of interest is not below the Base Rate of the bank.
3. Further, banks are advised to undertake a review of their loan policy  governing extension of credit facilities to the MSE sector, with a view to  using Board approved credit scoring models in their evaluation of the loan  proposals of MSE borrowers.
Yours faithfully
(Prakash Chandra Sahoo)
