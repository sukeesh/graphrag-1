The Chief Executive Officers of
All Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks
Dear  Sir / Madam,
Issue  of Pre-paid Payment Instruments-UCBs
Please refer to
circular  UBD (PCB) BPD Cir No.50/09.69.000/2005-06 dated April 28, 2006
permitting  Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs) to install ATMs and issue ATM-cum-Debit Cards.
2. We  have been receiving requests from a few UCBs to allow them to undertake Credit  / Pre-paid Card business. Taking into account the business profile of UCBs and the  nature of risks associated with Credit/ Pre-paid Card business, it has been  decided that UCBs which have installed ATMs and issued ATM-cum-Debit Cards may  introduce ‘Semi-Closed Pre-paid Payment Instruments’ permitting payment of  utility bill/ essential services up to a limit of
`
10,000/-. These payment instruments  shall be redeemable at a group of clearly identified merchant locations/  establishments which enter into contracts specifically with the UCB to accept  the payment instruments. These instruments shall not permit cash withdrawal or  redemption by the holder.
3. The  issuance and operations of these instruments shall be guided by the  instructions contained in
circular DPSS.CO.PD.No.1873/ 02.14.06/2008-09  dated April 27, 2009
and any other circular/  instructions issued in this regard from time to time by the Department of  Payment and Settlement Systems, Reserve Bank of India.
Yours faithfully,
(P K Arora)
General  Manager
