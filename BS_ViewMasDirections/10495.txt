The call/notice money market forms an important segment of the Indian Money Market. Under call money market, funds are transacted on an overnight basis and under notice money market, funds are transacted for a period between 2 days and 14 days.

2. Eligibility
CDs can be issued by (i) scheduled commercial banks {excluding Regional Rural Banks and Local Area Banks}; and (ii) select All-India Financial Institutions (FIs) that have been permitted by RBI to raise short-term resources within the umbrella limit fixed by RBI.
3. Aggregate Amount
3.1 Banks have the freedom to issue CDs depending on their funding requirements.
3.2 An FI can issue CDs within the overall umbrella limit prescribed in the Master Circular/Direction on Resource Raising Norms for FIs, issued by Department of Banking Regulation, Reserve Bank of India and updated from time-to-time.
4. Minimum Size of Issue and Denominations
Minimum amount of a CD should be Rs.1 lakh, i.e., the minimum deposit that could be accepted from a single subscriber should not be less than Rs.1 lakh, and in multiples of Rs. 1 lakh thereafter.
5. Investors
CDs can be issued to individuals, corporations, companies (including banks and PDs), trusts, funds, associations, etc. Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) may also subscribe to CDs, but only on non-repatriable basis, which should be clearly stated on the Certificate. Such CDs cannot be endorsed to another NRI in the secondary market.
6. Maturity
6.1 The maturity period of CDs issued by banks should not be less than 7 days and not more than one year, from the date of issue.
6.2 FIs can issue CDs for a period not less than 1 year and not exceeding 3 years from the date of issue.
7. Discount / Coupon Rate
CDs may be issued at a discount on face value. Banks / FIs are also allowed to issue CDs on floating rate basis provided the methodology of compiling the floating rate is objective, transparent and market-based. The issuing bank / FI is free to determine the discount / coupon rate. The interest rate on floating rate CDs would have to be reset periodically in accordance with a pre-determined formula that indicates the spread over a transparent benchmark. The investor should be clearly informed of the same.
8. Reserve Requirements
Banks have to maintain appropriate reserve requirements, i.e., Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR), on the issue price of the CDs.
9. Transferability
CDs in physical form are freely transferable by endorsement and delivery. CDs in demat form can be transferred as per the procedure applicable to other demat securities. There is no lock-in period for the CDs.
10. Trades in CDs
a. All OTC trades in CP shall be reported within 15 minutes of the trade to the Financial Market Trade Reporting and Confirmation Platform (“F-TRAC”) of Clearcorp Dealing System (India) Ltd. (CDSL).
b. The requirement of exchange of physical confirmation of trades matched on F- TRAC is waived subject to the following conditions:
Participants entering into one time bilateral agreement for eliminating the exchange of confirmation or multilateral agreement drafted by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association (
“FIMMDA”
) ;
Participants adhering to the extant laws such as stamp duty as may be applicable; and
Participants ensuring adherence to a sound risk management framework and complying with all the regulatory and legal requirements and practices, in this regard.
c. The list of entities, which have signed the multilateral agreement, will be published by FIMMDA and the Clearing Corporation of India Limited (CCIL) on their websites.
11. Settlement
All OTC trades in CDs shall necessarily be cleared and settled under DVP I mechanism through the authorised clearing houses {National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited (NSCCL), Indian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL) and MCX Stock Exchange Clearing Corporation Limited (CCL)} of the stock exchanges.
12. Loans / Buy-backs
Banks / FIs cannot grant loans against CDs. Furthermore, they cannot buy-back their own CDs before maturity. However, the RBI may relax these restrictions for temporary periods through a separate notification.
13. Format of CDs
Banks / FIs should issue CDs only in dematerialised form. However, according to the Depositories Act, 1996, investors have the option to seek certificate in physical form. Accordingly, if an investor insists on physical certificate, the bank / FI may inform the Chief General Manager, Financial Markets Regulation Department, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001 about such instances separately. Further, issuance of CDs will attract stamp duty. A format (Annex VII) is enclosed for adoption by banks / FIs. There will be no grace period for repayment of CDs. If the maturity date happens to be a holiday, the issuing bank / FI should make payment on the immediate preceding working day. Banks / FIs, therefore, should fix the period of deposit in such a manner that the maturity date does not coincide with a holiday to avoid loss of discount / interest rate.
14. Security Aspect
Since CDs in physical form are freely transferable by endorsement and delivery, it will be necessary for banks/FIs to see that the certificates are printed on good quality security paper and necessary precautions are taken to guard against tampering with the document. They should be signed by two or more authorised signatories.
15. Payment of Certificate
15.1 Since CDs are transferable, the physical certificates may be presented for payment by the last holder. The question of liability on account of any defect in the chain of endorsements may arise. It is, therefore, desirable that banks take necessary precautions and make payment only by a crossed cheque. Those who deal in these CDs may also be suitably cautioned.
15.2 The holders of dematted CDs will approach their respective depository participants (DPs) and give transfer / delivery instructions to transfer the security represented by the specific International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) to the 'CD Redemption Account' maintained by the issuer. The holders should also communicate to the issuer by a letter / fax enclosing the copy of the delivery instruction they had given to their respective DP and intimate the place at which the payment is requested to facilitate prompt payment. Upon receipt of the demat credit of CDs in the "CD Redemption Account", the issuer, on maturity date, would arrange to repay to holders / transferors by way of Banker's cheque / high value cheque, etc.
16. Issue of Duplicate Certificates
16.1 In case of loss of physical certificates, duplicate certificates can be issued after compliance with the following:
Notice is required to be given in at least one local newspaper;
Lapse of a reasonable period (say 15 days) from the date of the notice in the newspaper; and
Execution of an indemnity bond by the investor to the satisfaction of the issuer of CDs.
16.2 The duplicate certificate should be issued only in physical form. No fresh stamping is required as a duplicate certificate is issued against the original lost CD. The duplicate CD should clearly state that the CD is a Duplicate one stating the original value date, due date, and the date of issue (as "Duplicate issued on ________").
17. Accounting
Banks / FIs may account the issue price under the Head "CDs issued" and show it under deposits. Accounting entries towards discount will be made as in the case of "Cash Certificates". Banks / FIs should maintain a register of CDs issued with complete particulars.
18. Standardised Market Practices and Documentation
Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India (FIMMDA) may prescribe, in consultation with the RBI, for operational flexibility and smooth functioning of the CD market, any standardised procedure and documentation that are to be followed by the participants, in consonance with the international best practices. Banks / FIs may refer to the Handbook of Market Practices issued by FIMMDA in this regard in April, 2016 and as amended from time to time (
http://fimmda.org
).
19. Reporting
19.1 Banks should include the amount of CDs in the fortnightly return under Section 42 of the RBI Act, 1934 and also separately indicate the amount so included by way of a footnote in the return.
19.2 Further, banks / FIs should report the data on issuance of CDs on the web-based module under the Online Returns Filing System (ORFS) within 10 days from the end of the fortnight to which it pertains.
