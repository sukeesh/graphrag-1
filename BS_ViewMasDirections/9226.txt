Dear Sir/Madam,
Inoperative Accounts
Please refer to paragraph 1(iv) of our
circulars  RPCD.CO.RF.BC.No.89/07.38.01/2008-09 dated February 18, 2009
and
RPCD.CO.RRB.BC.No.108/03.05.33/2008-09 dated  May 22, 2009
on Unclaimed Deposits/Inoperative Accounts in State /  Central Cooperative Banks and Regional Rural Banks respectively in terms of  which a savings as well as current account should be treated as  inoperative/dormant if there are no transactions in the account for over a  period of two years. Further, in terms of paragraph 2(vi), for the purpose of  classifying an account as inoperative, both the types of transactions i.e.  debit as well as credit transactions induced at the instance of customers as  well as third party should be considered.
2. There may be instances where the customer has  given a mandate for crediting dividend on shares to Savings Bank account and  there are no other operations in the Savings Bank account. Some doubts have  arisen whether such an account is to be treated as an inoperative account after  two years.
3. In this connection, we clarify that since dividend  on shares is credited to Savings Bank accounts as per the mandate of the  customer, the same should be treated as a customer induced transaction. As  such, the account should be treated as operative account as long as the  dividend is credited to the Savings Bank account. The Savings Bank account can  be treated as inoperative account only after two years from the date of the  last credit entry of the dividend, provided there is no other customer induced  transaction.
Yours faithfully,
(A. Udgata)
