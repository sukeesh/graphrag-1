1. Primary Dealer System
1. Introduction
In 1995, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) introduced the system of Primary Dealers (PDs) in the Government Securities (G-Sec) Market. The objectives of the PD system are to strengthen the infrastructure in G-Sec market, development of underwriting and market making capabilities for G-Sec outside the RBI, improve secondary market trading system and to make PDs an effective conduit for open market operations (OMO).

PD license and other operational related issues will be guided by Master Circular issued by IDMD in this regard.

and
IDMD.PCD.11/14.03.06/2012-13 dated June 26, 2013

Exposure Norms
9.1 The extant exposure norms for standalone PDs are as follows:
The exposure ceiling limits would be 25 percent of latest audited Net Owned Funds (NOF) in case of a single borrower/counterparty and 40 percent of NOF in case of a group borrower/counterparty except for investments in AAA rated corporate bonds wherein exposure ceiling limits would be 50 percent of latest audited Net Owned Funds (NOF) in case of a single borrower/counterparty and 65 percent of NOF in case of a group borrower/counterparty.
The ceilings on single /group exposure limit would not be applicable where principal and interest are fully guaranteed by the Government of India.
PDs should include credit risk exposures to all other categories of non-Government securities including investments in mutual funds, commercial papers, certificate of deposits, positions in OTC derivatives not settled through Qualifying CCP (QCCP) etc. to compute extent of credit exposure to adhere to the prescribed prudential limits.
Clearing exposure to a QCCP will be kept outside of the exposure ceiling of 25 per cent of its NOF applicable to a single counter party.
Clearing exposure to QCCP would include trade exposure and default fund exposure as defined in the guidelines on capital requirements for PDs’ exposure to central counterparties issued vide
Circular IDMD.PCD.11/14.03.05/2013-14 dated March 27, 2014
.
Other permissible exposures to QCCPs such as investments in the capital of CCP etc. will continue to be within the existing exposure ceiling of 25 per cent of NOF to a single borrower/counterparty. However, all exposures of a PD to a non-QCCP should be within the exposure ceiling of 25 per cent.
Presently, there are four CCPs viz. Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL), National Securities Clearing Corporation Ltd. (NSCCL), Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd. (ICCL), and MCX-SX Clearing Corporation Ltd. (MCX-SXCCL) that are subjected, on an ongoing basis, to rules and regulations that are consistent with CPSS-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. While the CCIL has been granted the status of a QCCP by the Reserve Bank, the other three CCPs have been granted the status of QCCP by SEBI.
It may also be mentioned that the status of a CCP as a QCCP may change in future, if a regulator/supervisor of the CCP withdraws the status of QCCP. After withdrawal of the status of a QCCP, the CCP will be considered a non-QCCP and exposure norms as applicable to non-QCCPs would be applicable.
9.2 PDs should calculate exposure for various items as per
Master Circular on “Capital Adequacy Standards and Risk Management Guidelines for Standalone Primary Dealers”
dated July 1, 2015.
10.
Prudential Systems/Controls
10.1 PDs shall have an efficient internal control system for fair conduct of business, settlement of trades and maintenance of accounts.
PDs should maintain adequate physical infrastructure and skilled manpower for efficient participation in primary issues, trading in the secondary market, and to advise and educate investors.
In respect of transactions in G-Sec, a PD should have a separate desk and maintain separate accounts in respect of its own position and customer transactions and subject them to external audit also.
All the transactions put through by the PD either on outright basis or ready forward basis should be reflected on the same day in its books and records i.e. preparation of deal slip, contract note, confirmation of the counter party, recording of the transaction in the purchase/sale registers, etc.
For every transaction entered into, the trading desk should generate a deal slip which should contain data relating to nature of the deal, name of the counterparty, whether it is a direct deal or through a broker, and if through a broker, name of the broker, details of security, amount, price, contract date and time and settlement date. The deal slips should be serially numbered and controlled separately to ensure that each deal slip has been properly accounted for. Once the deal is concluded, the deal slip should be immediately passed on to the back office for recording and processing. For each deal, there must be a system of issue of confirmation to the counter-party. In view of the reporting and confirmation of OTC trades on Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) and guaranteed settlement through CCIL, the requirement to exchange written confirmation for OTC trades in G-Sec has been dispensed with. With respect to transactions matched on the NDS-OM module, separate counterparty confirmation of deals is not required.
Once a deal has been concluded, there should not be any substitution of the counter-party by the broker. Similarly, the security sold/purchased in a deal should not be substituted by another security under any circumstances.
On the basis of vouchers passed by the back office (which should be done after verification of actual contract notes received from the broker/counter-party and confirmation of the deal by the counter party), the books of account should be independently prepared.
PDs should periodically review securities transactions and report to the top management, the details of transactions in securities, details of funds/securities delivery failures, even in cases where shortages have been met by CCIL.
All security transactions (including transactions on account of clients) should be subjected to concurrent audit by internal/external auditors to the extent of 100% and the results of the audit should be placed before the CEO/MD of the PD once every month. The compliance should be monitored on ongoing basis and reported directly to the top management. The concurrent audit should also cover the business done through brokers and include the findings in their report.
The scope of concurrent audit should include monitoring of broker wise limits, prudential limits laid down by RBI, accuracy and timely submission of all regulatory returns, reconciliation of SGL/CSGL balances with PDO statements, reconciliation of current account balance with DAD statements, settlements through CCIL, stipulations with respect to short sale deals, when-issued transactions, constituent deals, money market deals, adherence to accounting standards, verification of deal slips, reasons for cancellation of deals, if any, transactions with related parties on ‘arm’s length basis’, provisions related to HTM portfolio etc.
PDs should have a system of internal audit focused on monitoring the efficacy and adequacy of internal control systems.
With the approval of their Board, PDs should put in place appropriate exposure limits / dealing limits, for each of their counterparties which cover all dealings with such counter parties including money market, repos and outright securities transactions. These limits should be reviewed periodically on the basis of financial statements, market reports, ratings, etc. and exposures taken only on a fully collateralized basis where there is slippage in the rating/assessment of any counterparty.
With the approval of their Boards, PDs should put in place reasonable leverage ratio for their operations, which should take into account all outside borrowings as a multiplier of their NOF.
There should be a clear functional separation of (i) trading (front office); (ii) risk management (mid office); and (iii) settlement, accounting and reconciliation (back office). Similarly, there should be a separation of transactions relating to own account and constituents’ accounts.
PDs should have an Audit Committee of the Board (ACB) which should meet at least at quarterly intervals. The ACB should peruse the findings of the various audits and should ensure efficacy and adequacy of the audit function.
10.2 Accounting Standards for securities transactions
All securities in trading portfolio should be marked to market, at appropriate intervals.
Costs such as brokerage fees, commission or taxes incurred at the time of acquisition of securities, are of revenue/deferred nature. The broken period interest received/paid also gets adjusted at the time of coupon payment. PDs can adopt either the IAS or GAAP accounting standards, but have to ensure that the method should be true and fair and should not result in overstating the profits or assets value. It should be followed consistently and be generally acceptable especially to the tax authorities.
Broken period interest paid to seller as part of cost on acquisition of Government and other securities should not be capitalized but treated as an item of expenditure under Profit and Loss Account. The PDs may maintain separate adjustment accounts for the broken period interest.
The valuation of the securities portfolio should be independent of the dealing and operations functions and should be done by obtaining the prices declared by FIMMDA periodically.
PDs should publish their audited annual results in leading financial dailies and on their website in the format prescribed (Annex VIII). The following minimum information should also be included by way of notes on accounts to the Balance Sheet:
Net borrowings in call (average and peak during the period),
Basis of valuation,
Leverage Ratio (average and peak),
CRAR (quarterly figures), and
Details of the issuer composition of non-G-Sec investments.
PDs may also furnish more information by way of additional disclosures.
11.
Trading of G-Sec on Stock Exchanges
11.1 With a view to encouraging wider participation of all classes of investors, including retail, in G-Sec, trading in G-Sec through a nationwide, anonymous, order driven screen based trading system on stock exchanges, in the same manner in which trading takes place in equities, has been permitted. Accordingly, trading of dated G-Sec in demat form is allowed on automated order driven system of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd., Mumbai (BSE), the Over the Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI) and the MCX Stock Exchange. This trading facility is in addition to the reporting/trading facility in the NDS. Being a parallel system, the trades concluded on the exchanges will be cleared by their respective clearing corporations/clearing houses.
11.2 PDs are expected to play an active role in providing liquidity to the G-Sec market and promote retailing. They may, therefore, make full use of the facility to distribute G-Sec to all categories of investors through the process of placing and picking-up orders on the exchanges. PDs may open demat accounts with a Depository Participant (DP) of NSDL/CDSL in addition to their accounts with RBI. Value free transfer of securities between SGL/CSGL and own demat account is enabled by PDO-Mumbai subject to guidelines issued by Department of Government and Bank Accounts (DGBA), RBI.

PDs should take specific approval from their Board to enable them to trade in the Stock Exchanges.
PDs may undertake transactions only on the basis of giving and taking delivery of securities.
Brokers/trading members shall not be involved in the settlement process. All trades have to be settled either directly with clearing corporation/clearing house (in case they are clearing members) or else through clearing member custodians.
The trades done through any single broker will also be subject to the current regulations on transactions done through brokers.
A standardized settlement on T+1 basis of all outright secondary market transactions in G-Sec has been adopted to provide the participants more processing time for transactions and to help in better funds as well as risk management.
In the case of repo transactions in G-Sec, however, market participants will have the choice of settling the first leg on either T+0 basis or T+1 basis, as per their requirements.
Any settlement failure on account of non-delivery of securities/ non-availability of clear funds will be treated as SGL bouncing and the current penalties in respect of SGL transactions will be applicable. Stock Exchanges will report such failures to the respective PDOs.
PDs who are trading members of the Stock Exchanges may have to put up margins on behalf of their non-institutional client trades. Such margins are required to be collected from the respective clients. PDs are not permitted to pay up margins on behalf of their client trades and incur overnight credit exposure to their clients. In so far as the intraday exposures on clients for margins are concerned, the PDs should be conscious of the underlying risks in such exposures.
PDs who intend to offer clearing /custodial services should take specific approval from SEBI in this regard. Similarly, PDs who intend to take trading membership of the Stock Exchanges should satisfy the criteria laid down by SEBI and the Stock Exchanges.
12.
Business through brokers
12.1 Business through brokers and limits for approved brokers
PDs may undertake securities transactions among themselves or with clients through the members of the BSE, NSE and OTCEI. However, if the PDs undertake OTC interest rate derivative transactions through brokers, they should ensure that these brokers are accredited by FIMMDA. PDs should fix aggregate contract limits for each of the approved brokers. A limit of 5% of total broker transactions (both purchase and sales) entered into by a PD during a year should be treated as the aggregate upper limit for each of the approved brokers. However, if for any reason it becomes necessary to exceed the aggregate limit for any broker, the specific reasons thereof should be recorded and the Board should be informed of this, post facto.
12.2 With the approval of their top management, PDs should prepare a panel of approved brokers, which should be reviewed annually or more often if so warranted. Clear-cut criteria should be laid down for empanelment of brokers, including verification of their creditworthiness, market reputation, etc. A record of broker-wise details of deals put through and brokerage paid, should be maintained.
12.3 Brokerage payable to the broker, if any (if the deal was put through with the help of a broker), should be clearly indicated on the notes/memorandum put up seeking approval for putting through the transaction, and a separate account of brokerage paid, broker-wise, should be maintained.
12.4 The role of the broker should be restricted to that of bringing the two parties to the deal together. Settlement of deals between PDs and counter-parties should be directly between the counter-parties and the broker will have no role in the settlement process.
12.5 While negotiating the deal, the broker is not obliged to disclose the identity of the counter-party to the deal. On conclusion of the deal, he should disclose the counter-party and his contract note should clearly indicate the name of the counter-party.
13.
Guidelines on declaration of dividend
PDs should follow the following guidelines while declaring dividend distribution:
The PD should have complied with the regulations on transfer of profits to statutory reserves and the regulatory guidelines relating to provisioning and valuation of securities, etc.
PDs having CRAR below the regulatory minimum of 15 per cent in any of the previous four quarters cannot declare any dividend. For PDs having CRAR at or above the regulatory minimum of 15 per cent during all the four quarters of the previous year, but lower than 20 per cent in any of the four quarters, the dividend payout ratio (DPR) should not exceed 33.3 per cent. For PDs having CRAR at 20 per cent or above during all the four quarters of the previous year, the DPR should not exceed 50 per cent. DPR should be calculated as a percentage of dividend payable in a year (excluding dividend tax) to net profit during the year.
The proposed dividend should be payable out of the current year’s profits. In case the profit for the relevant period includes any extraordinary income, the payout ratio should be computed after excluding such extraordinary items for reckoning compliance with the prudential payout ratio ceiling.
The financial statements pertaining to the financial year for which the PD is declaring dividend should be free of any qualifications by the statutory auditors, which have an adverse bearing on the profit during that year. In case of any qualification to that effect, the net profit should be suitably adjusted downward while computing the DPR.
In case there are special reasons or difficulties for any PD in strictly adhering to the guidelines, it may approach RBI in advance for an appropriate ad hoc dispensation in this regard.
All the PDs declaring dividend should report details of dividend declared during the accounting year as per the prescribed pro forma (Annex I) along with the Board resolution passed for declaration of dividend. The report should be furnished within a fortnight of payment of dividend.
14.
Guidelines on Corporate Governance
PDs may adhere to
circular DNBS.PD/CC 94/03.10.042/2006-07 dated May 8, 2007
on guidelines on corporate governance, as amended from time to time.
15.
Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 - Obligations of NBFCs
PDs shall adhere to the guidelines contained in
circular DNBS(PD).CC.68 /03.10.042/2005-06 dated April 5, 2006
, as amended from time to time, on the prevention of money laundering.
16.
Violation/Circumvention of Instructions
Any violation/circumvention of the above guidelines would be viewed seriously and such violation would attract penal action including the withdrawal of liquidity support, denial of access to the money market, withdrawal of authorization for carrying on the business as a PD, and/or imposition of monetary penalty or liquidated damages, as the RBI may deem fit.
17.
Disclosure of Penal Actions
17.1 In order to maintain transparency with regard to imposition of penalties and in conformity with the best practices on disclosure of penalties imposed by the regulator, the details of the penalty levied on a PD shall be placed in the public domain.
17.2 The mode of disclosures of penalties, imposed by RBI will be as follows:
A Press Release will be issued by the RBI, giving details of the circumstances under which the penalty is imposed on the PD along with the communication on the imposition of penalty in public domain.
The penalty shall also be disclosed in the 'Notes on Accounts' to the Balance Sheet of the PD in its next Annual Report.
