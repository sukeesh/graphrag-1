1. Introduction
1.1 All primary (urban) co-operative banks (UCBs) (scheduled as well as non-scheduled) are required to maintain stipulated level of cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR).
1.2 In regard to cash reserve, the provisions of section 42 (1) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (RBI Act, 1934), governs scheduled UCBs whereas, non scheduled UCBs are governed by the provisions of section 18 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (As Applicable to Co-operative Societies) [BR Act, 1949(AACS)].
1.3 The provisions of section 24 of the Act ibid govern maintenance of SLR for all banks (scheduled as well as non-scheduled).
1.4 The instructions on all these aspects which are operational as on date of this circular are detailed in the following paragraphs.
2. General
2.1 The various Forms/Returns are given in the Banking Regulation (Co-operative Societies) Rules, 1966.
2.2 In order to monitor the day-to-day position of liquidity of the bank, all UCBs are required to maintain a register, as per format given in Annex 8, showing the daily position of cash reserve and liquid assets maintained under sections 18 and 24 of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS).
2.3 The work of maintaining the register on daily basis may be entrusted to a responsible official and it should be put up daily to the Chief Executive Officer, who is responsible for ensuring compliance with the statutory liquidity requirements at the close of business every day.
2.4 To facilitate compilation of figures under various heads of the register, the explanations in respect of each item which form part of the Rules, as footnotes to Form I are given in the
Annex 9
. However, it may be noted that Scheduled UCBs are required to compute CRR requirements as per Section 42 of RBI Act, 1934.
3 Cash Reserves for Scheduled UCBs
3.1 Statutory CRR Requirements
Earlier, in terms of section 42(1) of the RBI Act, 1934, the scheduled UCBs were required to maintain with the Reserve Bank of India (Reserve Bank) during the fortnight, a minimum average daily balance of 3% of their total demand and time liabilities (DTL) in India obtaining on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight. Further, Reserve Bank was empowered to increase, through Gazette notification, the said rate up to 15% of the DTL. The RBI Act, 1934 was amended by Parliament in June 2006 and the Reserve Bank of India (Amendment) Bill, 2006 came into force with effect from April 1, 2007. As per the amendment, sub-section (1) of Section 42 of the RBI Act, 1934 was amended enabling the Reserve Bank, having regard to the needs of securing monetary stability in the country, to prescribe CRR for scheduled banks without any floor or ceiling rate. Accordingly, with effect from April 1, 2007, Reserve Bank having regard to the needs of securing the monetary stability in the country, prescribes the CRR for Scheduled UCBs without any floor or ceiling rate.
3.2 Incremental CRR
In terms of section 42(1) A of the RBI Act 1934, the Scheduled UCBs are required to maintain, in addition to the balances prescribed under Section 42(1) of the Act, an additional average daily balance, the amount of which shall not be less than the rate specified by the Reserve Bank in the notification published in the Gazette of India from time to time. Such additional balance will be calculated with reference to the excess of the total of demand and time liabilities (DTL) of the bank as shown in the return referred to in Section 42(2) of the RBI Act, 1934 over the total of its DTL at the close of the business on the date specified in the notification.
Currently Reserve Bank has not prescribed any incremental CRR.
3.3 Multiple Prescriptions for CRR
For the purpose of maintenance of CRR and SLR the Reserve Bank may specify from time to time with reference to any transaction or class of transactions that such transaction or transactions shall be treated as liability in India of a scheduled UCB.
3.4 Maintenance of CRR
At present with effect from the fortnight beginning from February 9, 2013, the CRR prescribed by the Reserve Bank is 4.0 per cent of a bank's total of demand and time liabilities adjusted for the exemptions discussed in section 3.11. The schedule of changes brought about in the CRR prescription has been detailed in the table below:

3.5 Maintenance of CRR on a daily basis
In order to provide flexibility to banks and enable them to choose an optimum strategy of holding reserves depending upon their intra period cash flow, scheduled UCBs are presently required to maintain on average daily balance, a minimum of 95 per cent of the prescribed CRR balance based on their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL).
3.6 Calculation of CRR
In order to improve the cash management by banks, as a measure of simplification, a lag of two weeks has been introduced in the maintenance of stipulated CRR by the scheduled banks. Thus, with effect from the fortnight beginning from November 6, 1999, the prescribed CRR during a fortnight has to be maintained by every bank based on its NDTL as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight i.e. based on the NDTL as on reporting Friday, October 22, 1999 and so on.
3.7 Computation of NDTL for CRR
i) Liabilities of a bank may be in the form of demand or time deposits or borrowings or other miscellaneous items of liabilities. As defined under Section 42 of RBI Act, 1934, liabilities of a bank may be towards banking system or towards others. ‘Demand Liabilities’ include all liabilities which are payable on demand. ‘Time Liabilities’ are those which are payable otherwise than on demand. Reserve Bank of India has been authorised in terms of Section 42 (1) (c) of RBI Act, 1934 to classify any particular liability and hence for any doubt regarding classification of a particular liability, banks are advised to approach Reserve Bank for necessary clarifications.
ii) The computation of DTL, liabilities to the banking system, and assets with the banking system, NDTL etc. are explained in detail in
Annex I
.
3.8 Borrowings from Banks abroad
Loans/borrowings from abroad by banks in India will be considered as 'liabilities to others' and will be subject to reserve requirements.
3.9 Arrangements with Correspondent Banks for remittance facilities
When a bank accepts funds from a client under its remittance facilities scheme, it becomes a liability (liability to others) in its books. The liability of the bank accepting funds will extinguish only when the correspondent bank honours the drafts issued by the accepting bank to its customers. As such, the balance amount in respect of the drafts issued by the accepting bank on its correspondent bank under the remittance facilities scheme and remaining unpaid should be reflected in the accepting bank's books as an outside liability under the head ' Liability to others in India' and the same should also be taken into account for computation of NDTL for CRR/SLR purpose.
The amount received by correspondent banks has to be shown as 'Liability to the Banking System' by them and not as 'Liability to others' and this liability could be netted off by the correspondent banks against the inter-bank assets. Likewise sums placed by banks issuing drafts/interest/dividend warrants are to be treated as 'Assets with Banking System' in their books and can be netted off from their inter-bank liabilities.
3.10 Loans out of Foreign Currency Non-Resident (Banks) (FCNR [B]) Deposits and Inter-Bank Foreign Currency (IBFC) Deposits
Loans out of FCNR [B] Deposits Scheme and IBFC Deposits should be included as part of bank credit while reporting in Form ’B’. For the purpose of reporting banks should convert their FCNR (B) Deposits, Overseas foreign currency assets and bank credit in India in foreign currency in 4 major currencies into rupees at Foreign Exchange Dealers’ Association of India (FEDAI) noon mean rate on the reporting Friday.
3.11 Exempted categories
Scheduled UCBs are exempted from maintaining CRR on the following liabilities:
(i) The liabilities to the Banking System as computed under clause (d) of explanation to section 42(1) of the RBI Act, 1934.
(ii) Credit balances in ACU (US$) accounts.
3.12 Maintenance of Cash Balances
For the purpose of maintaining CRR, every scheduled bank is required to maintain a Principal Account with the Deposit Accounts Department (DAD) of the Reserve Bank at the centre where the principal office of the bank is located.
3.13 No Interest on CRR balances maintained with Reserve Bank
In view of the amendment carried out to RBI Act 1934, omitting sub-section (1B) of section 42, the Reserve Bank does not pay any interest on the CRR balances maintained by Scheduled UCBs with effect from the fortnight beginning March 31, 2007.
3.14 Reporting Requirements
(i) In terms of Section 42(2) of the RBI Act, 1934 every scheduled bank is required to send to the Reserve Bank, a Return [Form B (
Annex 2
)] at the close of business on each alternate Friday within seven days after the date of which it relates, duly signed by two responsible officers of bank containing the relevant information. Where such alternate Friday is a public holiday under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, for one or more offices of the bank, the Return should give the preceding day's figures in respect of such office or offices, but should nevertheless be deemed to relate to that Friday.
(ii) Where the last Friday of a month is not an alternate Friday for the purpose of the above Return, the banks should send to Reserve Bank, a Special Return in Form B giving the same details as specified above as at the close of business on such last Friday or where such last Friday is a public holiday under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1981, as at the close of business on the preceding working day and such return should also be submitted within seven days after the date to which it relates.
(iii) Banks are required to calculate the proportion of their savings bank deposits as at the close of business on March 31 and September 30, into demand and time liabilities in terms of Regulation 7 of the RBI Act, 1934, Scheduled Bank's Regulations, 1951 and report in the prescribed form given in
Annex 2
.
(iv) Whenever there are wide variations between the sources and uses of funds as being reported in the fortnightly Return and the variations exceed 20 per cent, the banks concerned should advise the reasons for such wide variations in the return.
(v) In terms of Regulation 5(1) (c) of the Scheduled Banks Regulations, the banks are required to furnish a list of the names, the official designations and specimen signatures of the officers of the bank who are authorized to sign on behalf of the bank Returns prescribed under Section 42(2) of the RBI Act, 1934 of whom only two may sign such return. The bank has to submit to Reserve Bank fresh set of signatures whenever there is change in the incumbency.
3.15 Penalty for Non submission /delayed submission of Return
Failure to submit the Return/late submission of the Return attracts the provisions of section 42 (4) of RBI Act, 1934 and the banks are liable for imposition of penalties as indicated therein.
3.16 Penal Interest for Default in maintenance of CRR
(a) From the fortnight beginning June 24, 2006, the penal interest for default in maintenance of CRR is charged as under:
(i) In case of default in maintenance of CRR requirement on daily basis, which is presently 95 per cent of the total CRR requirement, penal interest will be recovered for that day at the rate of three per cent per annum above the bank rate on the amount by which the amount actually maintained falls short of the prescribed minimum on that day and if short fall continues on the next succeeding days, penal interest will be recovered at a rate of five per cent per annum above the bank rate.
(ii) In case of default in maintenance of CRR on average basis during a fortnight, penal interest will be recovered as envisaged in sub-section (3) of Section 42 of RBI Act, 1934.
(b) When under the provisions of Section 42 (3) of the RBI Act, 1934 penal interest at the increased rate of 5 per cent above bank rate has become payable-
(i) Every Director, Manager or Secretary of the scheduled bank who is knowingly and willfully a party to the default, shall be punishable with fine which may extend to five hundred Rupees and with a further fine which may extend to five hundred Rupees for each subsequent fortnight during which default continues.
(ii) The Reserve Bank may prohibit the scheduled bank from receiving any fresh deposit after the said fortnight, and if default is made by the bank in complying with the prohibition referred to in this clause, every director and officer of the bank who is knowingly and willfully a party to such default or who through negligence or otherwise contributes to such default shall in respect of each such default be punishable with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees and with a further fine which may extend to five hundred rupees for each day after the first, on which a deposit received in contravention of such prohibition is retained by the scheduled bank.
4. Cash Reserves for Non-Scheduled UCBs.
In terms of section 18 (1) of the BR Act, 1949, (AACS), every UCB (not being a scheduled bank) is required to maintain in India on a daily basis Cash Reserve, equivalent to such percent as the Reserve Bank may specify by notification in the Official Gazette from time to time, of its DTL in India on as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight and shall submit to the Reserve Bank before fifteenth day of every month a Return showing the amount so held on alternate Fridays during a month with particulars of DTL in India on such Fridays and if any such Friday is a public holiday under Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, at the close of business on the preceding working day. This balance may be maintained by way of cash resources with itself or by way of balance in a current account with the Reserve Bank or the State Co-operative Bank of the State concerned or by way of net balance in current accounts, or with the Central Co-operative Bank of the district concerned or in one or more of the aforesaid ways. The net balance in current accounts shall in relation to a co-operative bank mean the excess, if any, of the aggregate of the credit balances in current account maintained by that co-operative bank with the State Bank of India or a subsidiary bank or a corresponding new bank or IDBI Bank, over the aggregate of the credit balances in current accounts held by the said banks with such co-operative bank.
In terms of
Notification UBD.BPD.(PCB).Not.No.1/16.26.000/2013-14 dated June 5, 2014
, Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) required to be maintained by every Primary (Urban) Co-operative Bank, whether a scheduled co-operative bank or not, shall be 4 per cent of the total of demand and time liabilities, from the fortnight beginning from July 12, 2014.
4.1 Computation of NDTL for CRR
The computation of DTL, liabilities to the banking system, assets with the banking system, and NDTL, etc. are explained in detail in
Annex 3
.
4.2 Reporting Requirements
Non-scheduled banks are required to submit a Return in Form I, as per proforma given in
Annex 4
, to the Regional Office concerned of Reserve Bank not later than 20 days after the end of the month to which it relates showing the position, inter alia, of cash reserve maintained by the banks under section 18 of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS) as at the close of business on each alternate Friday during the month, with particulars of its DTL in India on such Fridays or if any such Friday is a public holiday under the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, at the close of business on the preceding working day. Non-scheduled banks are required to furnish in Appendix I, as per proforma given in
Annex 5
, along with the Return in Form I showing the position of the
(a) cash reserve required to be maintained under section 18 of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS)
(b) cash reserve actually maintained, and the
(c) extent of deficit/surplus for each day of the month.
4.3 Penalty
Non-scheduled banks should ensure to maintain the required cash reserve and submit the prescribed return along with Appendix I (
Annex 5
) within the stipulated time to the concerned Regional Offices. Failure to submit the Return in time attracts the provisions of section 46(4) of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS), and the banks are liable to imposition of penalties as indicated therein. The banks should, therefore, in their own interest ensure that the stipulations of the section 18 of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS) referred to above are strictly adhered to.
4.4 Penal Interest for Default in maintenance of CRR
In terms of Sub-section 1(A) of Section 18 of BR Act, 1949 (AACS), if the balance held by cooperative bank at the close of business on any day is below the minimum specified under sub-section (1), such co-operative bank shall, without prejudice to the provisions of any other law for the time being in force, be liable to pay to the Reserve Bank, in respect of that day, penal interest at a rate of three per cent. above the bank rate on the amount by which such balance falls short of the specified minimum, and if the shortfall continues further, the penal interest so charged shall be increased to a rate of five per cent. above the bank rate in respect of each subsequent day during which the default continues.
5. Statutory Liquidity Reserves (Scheduled and Non-Scheduled UCBs)
In terms of section 24 (2A) of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS), every co-operative bank in addition to the Cash Reserve required to be maintained under section 18 (1), shall maintain in India, liquid assets, the value which shall not be less than such percentage as may be specified by Reserve Bank in the Official Gazette from time to time and not exceeding forty percentage of its NDTL in India as on the last Friday of the second preceding fortnight.
5.1 Current Prescription for SLR
Pursuant to the enactment of the Banking Laws (Amendment) Act, 2012, giving powers to RBI to specify the percentage of SLR as well as the form and manner of holding SLR by co-operative banks, it was decided to reduce the SLR for all Urban Co-operative Banks from 25.00 per cent to 22.50 per cent of their total demand and time liabilities with effect from the fortnight beginning July 12, 2014. With effect from February 7, 2015, the SLR for all UCBs is 21.50% of NDTL. Urban Co-operative Banks not maintaining SLR in three forms i.e. cash, gold and approved securities were given time upto March 31, 2015 to comply with instructions contained in the Notification UBD.BPD.(PCB).Not. No.2/16.26.000/2013-14 dated June 5, 2014 (
Annex 10
). In the interim period, Urban Co-operative Banks were permitted to maintain SLR as per instructions contained in circulars UBD.BR.Cir.19/16.26.00/2001-02 dated October 22, 2001 and
UBD.(PCB). CO.BPD.Cir.28/16.26.00/2008-09 dated November 26, 2008
. However, term deposits held by Primary (Urban) Co-operative Banks with Public Sector Banks were also made eligible for being reckoned for SLR purpose in the interim period, upto March 31, 2015. It may be noted that balances kept with State Co-operative Banks / District Central Co-operative Banks as also term deposits with public sector banks are now not eligible for being reckoned for SLR purpose w.e.f April 1, 2015.
5.2 Calculation of SLR
The compliance with a daily statement to banks/Reserve Bank listing the securities lodged/utilised this obligation is monitored ordinarily with reference to the position of the SLR as on the relevant alternate Friday as shown in the return in Form I.
Banks are also required to maintain SLR on borrowing through CBLO. However, securities lodged in the Gilt Account of the bank maintained with Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) under Constituent Subsidiary General Ledger account (CSGL) facilities remaining unencumbered at the end of any day can be reckoned for SLR purposes by the bank concerned. For this purpose, CCIL will provide a daily statement to banks/Reserve Bank listing the securities lodged/utilised/remaining unencumbered.
The details on computation of SLR are furnished in the
Annex 3
.
5.3 Manner of Maintaining Statutory Liquidity Reserves
The liquid assets may be maintained –
(i) in cash, or
(ii) in gold valued at a price not exceeding the current market price, or
(iii) Unencumbered investment in approved securities as defined in section 5(a) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10 of 1949) read with section 56 thereof.
For further explanations, please refer Notification UBD.BPD.(PCB).Not.No. 2/16.26.000/2013-14 dated June 5, 2014 (
Annex 10
).
(In terms of circular No. IDMD.3426/11.01.01/(D) 225-06 dated March 03, 2006, all Negotiated Dealing System-Order Matching (NDS-OM) segment members were allowed to undertake ‘When Issued transactions’ on NDS-OM platform. The securities bought in the ‘When Issued’ market would be eligible for SLR purposes, only on delivery.)
Note:
Unencumbered deposits with state/district central co-operative bank of the state/district concerned:
a) Wherever a district is served by more than one central co-operative bank, the area of operations of each central co-operative bank within the district is quite distinct and separate as per the provisions of the bye-laws of the central co-operative bank concerned. The primary cooperative banks operating in the area of the central co-operative bank concerned in the district will be normally affiliated to that central co-operative bank. Therefore, the central co-operative bank concerned in the district to which the primary co-operative bank is affiliated, or in whose area the primary co-operative bank has its registered office, will be the central cooperative bank of the district concerned for the purposes of Sections 18 & 24 of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS).
b) Where a primary co-operative bank operates beyond such area, by opening branches in areas served by other central co-operative banks in the district, it can treat its balances with latter also as cash reserve or liquid assets, as the case may be.
(Legally speaking, the banks may invest in gold (including gold ornaments) to maintain liquid assets. However, such investments are of unproductive nature and yield no income, except price increase, which is subject to speculative forces. Keeping these aspects in view as well as the difficulties involved in valuation, safekeeping, etc., the banks should not invest in gold to maintain liquid assets for SLR purposes.)
All UCBs are required to maintain investments in Government Securities only in Subsidiary General Ledger (SGL) Accounts with Reserve Bank or in CSGL Accounts of scheduled commercial banks, Primary Dealers (PDs), State Co-operative Banks, and Stock Holding Corporation of India Ltd.(SHCIL) or in the dematerialised accounts with depositories such as National Securities Depositories Ltd (NSDL), Central Depository Services Ltd. (CDSL), and National Securities Clearing Corporation Ltd. (NSCCL).
5.4 Explanations / Requirements regarding Approved Securities
(i) In terms of section 5(a) of BR Act, 1949 (AACS), ‘‘approved securities’’ means the securities issued by the Central Government or any State Government or such other securities as may be specified by the Reserve Bank from time to time. The SLR status of securities issued by Government of India and the State Governments will be indicated in the Press Release issued by the Reserve Bank at the time of issuance of the securities. An updated and current list of the SLR securities is available on the Reserve Bank’s website (
www.rbi.org.in
) under the link ‘Database on Indian Economy’. In case of any doubt regarding the classification of a security for the purpose of section 24, the banks may seek clarifications from Reserve Bank.)
(ii) Banks may reckon their reserve fund investments in fixed deposits, or the investments in approved securities as SLR assets provided they are unencumbered.
(iii) "Unencumbered investment" of a primary co-operative bank shall include its investment in the approved securities lodged with another institution for an advance or any other credit arrangement to the extent to which such securities have not been drawn against or availed of.
5.5 Classification and Valuation of Securities for SLR
(i) The Classification and Valuation of Securities for SLR will be done as specified by the Reserve Bank from time to time. For detailed instruction on classification and valuation of securities for SLR, please refer to
Master circular No DCBR.BPD(PCB).MC.No.4/16.20.000/2015-16 dated July 01, 2015
.
(ii) A format for reporting the data is given in
Annex 6
. Information in the format may be furnished as an Annex, to return in Form I, only to the Regional Office concerned of this department with effect from 2003. The monthly Return should contain information of the fortnights following in the respective months.
5.6 Computation of NDTL for SLR
(i) The net liabilities to the ‘Banking System’ as computed under clause (d) of explanation to section 18(1) of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS) are exempted from maintenance of SLR.
(ii) The procedure followed for working out net inter-bank liabilities for the purpose of SLR should be in accordance with clause (d) of explanation to section 18(1) of the BR Act, 1949(AACS). The procedure to compute total NDTL for the purpose of SLR and minimum percentage of SLR under section 24(2A) of BR Act, 1949 (AACS) must be similar to the procedure followed for computation of CRR as detailed in
Annex 3
.
(iii) In terms of clause (d) of explanation to section 18(1) of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS) the amount of net inter-bank liabilities is to be calculated after reducing 'assets with banking system' from 'liabilities to the banking system'. If it is a positive figure, it should be added to 'liabilities to others' to arrive at total NDTL. If it is a negative figure, net inter-bank liabilities would be considered as zero and 'liabilities to others' would be considered as total NDTL. For the purpose of working out liabilities, subject to a prescribed SLR under the law, if net inter-bank liabilities are positive it should be deducted from total NDTL. However, for the purpose of working out minimum SLR on total NDTL, net inter-bank liabilities should also be included.
(iv) The computation of DTL, liabilities to the banking system, assets with the banking system, and NDTL, etc. are explained in detail in
Annex 3
.
(v) In case a UCB has availed a loan from DCCB/SCB with which it maintains deposits, for the computation of SLR, the amount of loan availed should be deducted from deposits irrespective of whether a lien has been marked on such deposits or not, as in case of default the lender bank can exercise the lien and the deposits may not be available to meet the liquidity needs.
5.7 Reporting Requirements
(i) All UCBs (scheduled and non-scheduled), are required to submit a Return in Form I (as detailed in
Annex 4
) under section 24 of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS) every month showing the position of liquid assets maintained under the said section as at the close of business on each alternate Friday during the month.
[Note: In respect of Non-Scheduled UCBs, Return in Form I is common for reporting cash reserves and statutory liquid assets.]
(ii) All UCBs (scheduled and non-scheduled) are required to furnish Appendix II, as per proforma given in
Annex 7
, along with the Return in Form I showing the position of -
(a) statutory liquid assets required to be maintained under Section 24 of the BR Act,1949 (AACS).
(b) liquid assets actually maintained, and
(c) the extent of deficit/surplus for each day of the month.
5.8 Penal Provisions
(i) In terms of section 24(4)(a) of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS), if on any alternate Friday or, if such Friday is a public holiday, on the preceding working day, the amount maintained by any bank at the close of business on that day falls below the minimum prescribed by or under clause 24(2A)(a), the bank shall be liable to pay to the Reserve Bank in respect of that day’s default, penal interest for that day at the rate of 3 per cent per annum above the bank rate on the amount by which the amount actually maintained falls short of the prescribed minimum on that day.
(ii) Further, vide section 24(4)(b), if the default occurs again on the next succeeding alternate Friday, or, if such Friday is a public holiday, on the preceding working day, and continues on succeeding alternate Fridays or preceding working days, as the case may be, the rate of penal interest shall be increased to a rate of 5 per cent per annum above the bank rate on each such shortfall in respect of that alternate Friday and each succeeding alternate Friday or preceding working day, if such Friday is a public holiday, on which the default continues.
(iii) Without prejudice to the provisions of section 24(4), on the failure of any bank to maintain on any day, the amount so required to be made by or under clause (a) of section 24(2A), the Reserve Bank under Section 24(5)(a) may, in respect of such default, require the concerned bank to pay penal interest for that day as provided in section 24(4)(a) and if the default continues on the next succeeding working day, the penal interest may be increased as provided in section 24(4)(b) for the days concerned.
(iv) In terms of the provisions of Section 24 (6) (a) the penalty payable under sub Sections (4) and (5) is to be paid by the banks within a period of thirty days from the date on which the notice is issued by the Reserve Bank.
(v) Banks should invariably ensure to maintain the required SLR and submit the prescribed Return along with Appendix II (Annex 8) within the stipulated time to Regional Offices concerned. Failure to submit the Return in time will attract the provisions of section 46(4) of the Act ibid and the banks will be liable to imposition of penalties as indicated therein.
(vi) Where it is observed that banks are persistently defaulting despite instructions and repeated advice, the Reserve Bank in addition to levy of penalty on such defaulting banks, may be constrained to consider cancelling the license in case of licensed banks and refuse license in case of unlicensed banks under section 22 of the Act, ibid. The banks should, therefore, in their own interest ensure maintenance of statutory liquidity ratio at prescribed rates and be very prompt in submission of Return in Form I, Form IX, Form 'B' to Regional Office concerned of Reserve Bank.
5.9 Other Penal Provisions
i) Apart from maintenance of CRR and SLR at the prescribed rates, banks are also required to submit relative statutory Returns well in time to the Regional Office concerned of Reserve Bank. Any violation of these statutory requirements, apart from levy of penal interest would also attract penalties under Section 46(4), read with Section 56 of the BR Act, 1949 (AACS).
ii) Whenever any bank fails to maintain the requisite amount of Cash Reserve/Liquid Assets, it should explain the reasons for such default in the letter forwarding the Return.
