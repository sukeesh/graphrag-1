Madam/Dear Sir,
Know Your Customer (KYC)  Norms – Creating Public Awareness
The Reserve Bank of India, in the recent times, has  been taking several measures to simplify KYC requirements to help the common  man open bank accounts. It is, however, observed that despite such measures the  general public is still facing problems in opening a bank account as these  measures have not been given adequate publicity and the common man still lacks  awareness on the basics of opening a bank account.
2. In order to address these issues, create  public awareness and give wide publicity to these KYC simplification measures,  Reserve Bank has issued a Press Release together with
a poster
and
a booklet
comprising a few common questions relating to  Know Your Customer (KYC) norms for opening bank accounts. These are available  on our website at
http://rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_PressReleaseDisplay.aspx?prid=31935
.
3. In this regard, banks are also advised to  initiate steps to create awareness and give wider publicity by circulating the  poster and booklet amongst all their branches. Branches may be advised to make  available the booklet to the customers/ general public and display the poster  prominently in their premises. Progress made in this regard would be reviewed  by Reserve Bank in due course.
4. Banks may ensure strict compliance of these  instructions
Yours faithfully
(Suma Varma)
Chief General Manager
