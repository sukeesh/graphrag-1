1. Introduction
Recognising considerable divergence amongst the financial institutions in the nature and manner of disclosures made by them in their published financial statements, disclosure norms were introduced by Reserve Bank of India for financial institutions in March 2001 with a view to bringing about uniformity in the disclosure practices adopted by them and improving the degree of transparency in their affairs. Such disclosures, which came into effect from the financial year 2000-2001 and were subsequently enhanced, are required to be made as part of "Notes to Accounts" to enable the auditors to authenticate the information, notwithstanding the fact that the same information might be contained elsewhere in the published financial statements. These disclosures constitute only minima and if an FI desires to make any additional disclosures, it would be well advised to do so.
2. Guidelines on Disclosure Requirements
The various disclosure requirements are as under :
2.1 Capital

* Excluding the figures of Standard Restructured Advances which do not attract higher provisioning or risk weight (if applicable).
For the purpose of disclosure in the above Format, the following instructions are required to be followed :
(i) Advances restructured under CDR Mechanism, SME Debt Restructuring Mechanism and other categories of restructuring should be shown separately.
(ii) Under each of the above categories, restructured advances under their present asset classification, i.e. standard, sub-standard, doubtful and loss should be shown separately.
(iii) Under the 'standard' restructured accounts; accounts, which have objective evidence of no longer having inherent credit weakness, need not be disclosed. For this purpose, an objective criteria for accounts not having inherent credit weakness is discussed below :
(a) As regards restructured accounts classified as standard advances, in view of the inherent credit weakness in such accounts, banks are required to make a general provision higher than what is required for otherwise standard accounts in the first two years from the date of restructuring. In case of moratorium on payment of interest / principal after restructuring, such advances attract the higher general provision for the period covering moratorium and two years thereafter.
(b) Further, restructured standard unrated corporate exposures and housing loans are also subjected to an additional risk weight of 25 percentage point with a view to reflect the higher element of inherent risk which may be latent in such entities (cf. paragraph 5.8.3 of
circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.90/20.06.001/2006-07 dated April 27, 2007
on 'Prudential Guidelines on Capital Adequacy and Market Discipline - Implementation of the New Capital Adequacy Framework' and paragraph 4 of
circular DBOD.No.BP.BC.76/21.04.0132/2008-09 dated November 3, 2008
on 'Prudential Guidelines on Restructuring of Advances by Banks' respectively).
(c) The aforementioned [(a) and (b)] additional / higher provision and risk weight cease to be applicable after the prescribed period if the performance is as per the rescheduled programme. However, the diminution in the fair value will have to be assessed on each balance sheet date and provision should be made as required.
(d) Restructured accounts classified as sub-standard and doubtful (non-performing) advances, when upgraded to standard category also attract a general provision higher than what is required for otherwise standard accounts for the first year from the date of up-gradation, in terms of extant guidelines on provisioning requirement of restructured accounts. This higher provision ceases to be applicable after one year from the date of upgradation if the performance of the account is as per the rescheduled programme. However, the diminution in the fair value will have to be assessed on each balance sheet date and provision made as required.
(e) Once the higher provisions and / or risk weights (if applicable and as prescribed from time to time by RBI) on restructured standard advances revert to the normal level on account of satisfactory performance during the prescribed periods as indicated above, such advances, henceforth, would no longer be required to be disclosed by banks as restructured standard accounts in the "Notes on Accounts" in their Annual Balance Sheets. However, banks should keep an internal record of such restructured accounts till the provisions for diminution in fair value of such accounts are maintained.
(iv) Disclosures should also indicate the intra category movements both on upgradation of restructured NPA accounts as well as on slippage. These disclosures would show the movement in restructured accounts during the financial year on account of addition, upgradation, downgradation, write off, etc.
(v) While disclosing the position of restructured accounts, banks must disclose the total amount outstanding in all the accounts / facilities of borrowers whose accounts have been restructured along with the restructured part or facility. This means that even if only one of the facilities / accounts of a borrower has been restructured, the bank should also disclose the entire outstanding amount pertaining to all the facilities / accounts of that particular borrower.
(vi) Upgradation during the year (Sl No. 3 in the Disclosure Format) means movement of 'restructured NPA' accounts to 'standard asset classification from substandard or doubtful category' as the case may be. These will attract higher provisioning and / or risk weight' during the 'prescribed period' as prescribed from time to time. Movement from one category into another will be indicated by a (-) and a (+) sign respectively in the relevant category.
(vii) Movement of Restructured standard advances (Sr. No. 4 in the Disclosure Format) out of the category into normal standard advances will be indicated by a (-) sign in the column "Standard".
(viii) Downgradation from one category to another would be indicated by (-) ve and (+) ve sign in the relevant categories.
(ix) Upgradation, downgradation and write-offs are from their existing asset classifications.
(x) All disclosures are on the basis of current asset classification and not 'pre-restructuring' asset classification.
(xi) Additional / fresh sanctions made to an existing restructured account can be shown under Sr. No. 2 'Fresh Restructuring during the year' with a footnote stating that the figures under Sr. No.2 include Rs. xxx crore of fresh / additional sanction (number of accounts and provision thereto also) to existing restructured accounts. Similarly, reductions in the quantity of restructured accounts can be shown under Sr.No.6 'write-offs of restructured accounts during the year' with a footnote stating that that it includes Rs. xxx crore (no. of accounts and provision thereto also) of reduction from existing restructured accounts by way of sale / recovery.
(xii) Closing balance as on March 31st of a FY should tally arithmetically with opening balance as on April 1st of the FY + Fresh Restructuring during the year including additional / fresh sanctions to existing restructured accounts + Adjustments for movement across asset categories - Restructured standard advances which cease to attract higher risk weight and / or provision - reductions due to write-offs / sale / recovery, etc. However, if due to some unforeseen / any other reason, arithmetical accuracy is not achieved, then the difference should be reconciled and explained by way of a foot-note.

As announced in
paragraph 28
of the Sixth Bi-Monthly Monetary Policy Statement, 2014-15 on February 03, 2015 All-India Term Lending and Refinancing Institutions (AIFIs) are permitted to reverse the excess provision (when the sale is for a value higher than the NBV) on sale of NPAs (sold prior to February 26, 2014 to SCs/RCs) to their profit and loss account. AIFIs can reverse excess provision arising out of sale of NPAs only when the cash received (by way of initial consideration and/or redemption of security receipts/pass through certificates) is higher than the NBV of the NPAs sold to SCs/RCs.
3. Further, the quantum of excess provision reversed to profit and loss account will be limited to the extent to which cash received exceeds the NBV of the NPAs sold. The quantum of excess provision reversed to the profit and loss account on account of sale of NPAs shall be disclosed in the financial statements of the bank under ‘Notes to Accounts’.
4. To enhance transparency, in addition to the disclosure requirements quoted above, AIFIs shall make the following disclosures in the Notes to Accounts in their Annual Financial Statements:

A parent, presenting the CFS, should consolidate the financial statements of all subsidiaries - domestic as well as foreign, except those specifically permitted to be excluded under the AS-21 the ICAI. The reasons for not consolidating a subsidiary should be disclosed in the CFS. The responsibility of determining whether a particular entity should be included or not for consolidation would be that of the Management of the parent entity. In case, its Statutory Auditors are of the opinion that an entity, which ought to have been consolidated, has been omitted, they should incorporate their comments in this regard in the "Auditors Report".
2.11.2 Accounting Policies
CFS should be prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. (For the purpose, the FIs should rely on a Statement of Adjustments for non-uniform accounting policies furnished by the statutory auditors of the subsidiaries.) If it is not practicable to do so, that fact should be disclosed together with the proportions of the items in the consolidated financial statements to which the different accounting policies have been applied.
2.12 Disclosures on Risk Exposures in Derivatives
Best international practices require meaningful and appropriate disclosures of FIs' exposures to risk and their strategy towards managing the risk. FIs should make meaningful disclosures of their derivatives portfolio. A minimum framework for disclosures by FIs on their risk exposures in derivatives is furnished in
Annex 2
. The disclosure format includes both qualitative and quantitative aspects and has been devised to provide a clear picture of the exposure to risks in derivatives, risk management systems, objectives and policies. FIs should make these disclosures as a part of the 'Notes on Accounts' to the Balance Sheet with effect from March 31, 2005 (June 30, 2005 in the case of National Housing Bank).
2.13 Exposures where the FI had exceeded the Prudential Exposure Limits during the year
The FI should make appropriate disclosures in the 'Notes on account' to the annual financial statements in respect of the exposures where the FI had exceeded the prudential exposure limits during the year.
2.14 Additional Disclosures by FIs in Notes to Accounts
Reserve Bank has been taking several steps from time to time to enhance transparency in the operations of FIs by stipulating comprehensive disclosures in tune with the international best practices.

This disclosure is required to be made in 'Notes to Accounts' in FI's audited Annual Financial Statements.
Notes :
(I) CRAR and other parameters
CRAR and other related parameters, determined as per the extant capital adequacy norms for the FIs, should be disclosed.
(II) Asset Quality and Credit Concentration
For the purpose of asset quality and credit concentration, the following should also be reckoned for determining the amount of loans and advances and NPAs and included in the disclosures :
(i) Bonds and Debentures :
The bonds and debentures should be treated in the nature of advance when :
- The debenture / bond is issued as part of the proposal for project finance and the tenor of the bond / debenture is for three years and above.
and
- The FI has a significant stake (i.e. 10% or more) in the issue.
and
- The issue is a part of private placement i.e. the borrower has approached the FI, and not part of a public issue where the FI has subscribed in response to an invitation.
(ii) Preference Shares :
The preference shares, other than convertible preference shares, acquired as part of project financing and meeting the criteria as at (i) above.
(iii) Deposits :
The deposits placed with the corporate sector.
(III) Credit Exposure
"Credit exposure" shall include funded and non-funded credit limits, underwriting and other similar commitments. The sanctioned limits or outstandings , whichever is higher, shall be reckoned for arriving at exposure limit. In case of term loans, however, the exposure limit should be reckoned on the basis of actual outstandings plus undisbursed or undrawn commitments.
However, in cases where disbursements are yet to commence, exposure limit should be reckoned on the basis of the sanctioned limit or the extent upto which the FI has entered into commitments with the borrowing companies in terms of the agreement.
FIs should include in the non-funded credit limit, the forward contracts in foreign exchange and other derivative products like currency swaps, options, etc as per the extant exposure norms.
(IV) Capital Funds
Capital funds for the purpose of credit concentration, would be the total regulatory capital as defined under capital adequacy standards (i.e. Tier I and Tier II Capital).
(V) Definition of Borrower Group
The definition of 'borrower group' would be the same as applied by the FIs in complying with group exposure norms.

2. FIs should adopt the Current Exposure Method prescribed by RBI on Measurement of Credit Exposure of Derivative Products which is described in brief as follows :
In order to calculate the credit exposure equivalent of off-balance sheet interest rate and exchange rate instruments under Current Exposure Method, a FI would sum :
- the total replacement cost (obtained by "marking to market") of all its contracts with positive value (i.e., when the FI has to receive money from the counterparty), and
- an amount for potential future changes in credit exposure calculated on the basis of the total notional principal amount of the contract multiplied by the following credit conversion factors according to the residual maturity of the contract :
Residual Maturity
Conversion Factor to be applied on Notional Principal Amount
Interest Rate Contract

Less than one year
Nil
1.0 %
One year and over

3. Bilateral netting of mark-to-market (MTM)values arising on account of counterparty credit exposures in derivatives contracts cannot be permitted. Accordingly, FIs should count their gross positive MTM value of such contracts for the purposes of capital adequacy as well as for exposure norms.
