Dear Sir/ Madam,
Reporting of OTC Interest Rate  Derivatives – Client Level Transactions
Please refer to our
circular FMD.MSRG.No.94/02.05.002/2013-14  dated December 04, 2013
wherein it was advised that the existing reporting  arrangement for the client level Rupee Interest Rate Swap (IRS)/Forward Rate  Agreement (FRA) transactions by banks and primary dealers shall be dispensed  with after stabilisation of the trade reporting arrangement put in place with  CCIL on December 30, 2013. The reporting of client level Rupee IRS/FRA  transactions to CCIL’s platform that commenced on December 30, 2013 has since  stabilised and the CCIL has completed capturing of all the outstanding  transactions as on the date of commencement of the reporting. Accordingly, it  has now been decided that with effect from week ending April 4, 2014, the  reporting arrangement wherein banks and primary dealers report the client level  IRS/FRA transactions to the Financial Markets Department on a weekly basis in  the specified format in physical form/through e-mail and on the Banks’ Online  Returns Filing System (ORFS), will be dispensed with. The banks and primary  dealers may continue reporting the transactions to the CCIL’s reporting  platform.
Yours sincerely
(G. Mahalingam)
Principal Chief General Manager
