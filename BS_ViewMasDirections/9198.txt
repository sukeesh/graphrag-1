Dear  Sir/Madam,
Timelines for Credit Decisions
Please refer to our circulars IECD.No.24/08.13.08/96-97  dated April 15, 1997 and IECD.No.12/08.13.08/96-97 dated October 29, 1996 in  terms of which instructions relating to formation of consortium by banks beyond  a threshold limit were withdrawn. Banks were allowed to evolve appropriate  mechanism for adoption of sole bank/multiple bank/consortium or syndication  approach, by framing necessary ground rules on operational aspects. The  objective of granting operational freedom was to expedite the process of credit  decisions.
2. It has, however, been brought to our  notice that there have been inordinate delays on part of banks in conveying  their credit decisions leading to delays in project implementation. While banks  are required to carry out necessary due diligence before arriving at credit  decisions, timely and adequate availability of credit is a pre-requisite for  successful implementation of large projects. In this connection, banks’  attention is drawn to the guidelines contained in
circular  DBOD.Leg.No.BC.104/ 09.07.007/2002-03 dated May 5, 2003
on ‘Guidelines on  Fair Practices Code for Lenders’, wherein we have stipulated that the time  frame within which loan applications up to Rs.2 lakh will be disposed of should  be indicated at the time of acceptance of loan applications. It is felt that a  similar practice of time bound decision making may be required in the case of  other loans too.
3. It is, therefore, advised that banks should clearly  delineate the procedure for disposal of loan proposals, with appropriate  timelines, and institute a suitable monitoring mechanism for reviewing  applications pending beyond the specified period. It is, however, reiterated that there  should not be any compromise on due diligence requirements. Banks may also make  suitable disclosures on the timelines for conveying credit decisions through their  websites, notice-boards, product literature, etc.
4. Banks may put in place the above system  within 30 days from the date of this circular.
Yours faithfully,
(Sudarshan Sen)
