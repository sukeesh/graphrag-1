Introduction
Certificate of Deposit (CD) is a negotiable  money market instrument and issued in dematerialised form or as a Usance  Promissory Note against funds deposited at a bank or other eligible financial  institution for a specified time period. Guidelines for issue of CDs are  presently governed by various directives / guidelines issued by the Reserve  Bank of India (RBI), as amended from time to time. The guidelines for issue of  CDs, incorporating all the amendments issued till date, are given below for  ready reference.
2. Eligibility
CDs can be issued by (i) scheduled commercial  banks {excluding Regional Rural Banks and Local Area Banks}; and (ii) select  All-India Financial Institutions (FIs) that have been permitted by RBI to raise  short-term resources within the umbrella limit fixed by RBI.
3. Aggregate Amount
3.1 Banks have the freedom to issue CDs depending on  their funding requirements.
3.2  An FI can issue CDs within the overall umbrella limit prescribed in the Master  Circular on Resource Raising Norms for FIs, issued by DBOD and updated from  time-to-time.
4. Minimum Size of  Issue and Denominations
Minimum amount of a CD should be Rs.1 lakh,  i.e., the minimum deposit that could be accepted from a single subscriber  should not be less than Rs.1 lakh, and in multiples of Rs. 1 lakh thereafter.
5. Investors
CDs can be issued to individuals, corporations,  companies (including banks and PDs), trusts, funds, associations, etc.  Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) may also subscribe to CDs, but only on  non-repatriable basis, which should be clearly stated on the Certificate. Such CDs  cannot be endorsed to another NRI in the secondary market.
6. Maturity
6.1 The maturity period of CDs issued  by banks should not be less than 7 days and not more than one year, from the  date of issue.
6.2  FIs can issue CDs for a period not less than 1 year and not exceeding 3 years  from the date of issue.
7. Discount / Coupon  Rate
CDs may be issued at a discount on face value.  Banks / FIs are also allowed to issue CDs on floating rate basis provided the  methodology of compiling the floating rate is objective, transparent and  market-based. The issuing bank / FI is free to determine the discount / coupon  rate. The interest rate on floating rate CDs would have to be reset  periodically in accordance with a pre-determined formula that indicates the spread  over a transparent benchmark. The investor should be clearly informed of the  same.
8. Reserve  Requirements
Banks have to maintain appropriate reserve  requirements, i.e., cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio  (SLR), on the issue price of the CDs.
9. Transferability
CDs in physical form are freely transferable by  endorsement and delivery. CDs in demat form can be transferred as per the  procedure applicable to other demat securities. There is no lock-in period for  the CDs.
10. Trades in CDs
All OTC trades in CDs shall be reported within  15 minutes of the trade on the reporting platform of Clearcorp Dealing Systems (India) Ltd. (CDSIL).
11. Settlement
All  OTC trades in CDs shall necessarily be cleared and settled under DVP I mechanism  through the authorised clearing houses {National Securities Clearing  Corporation Limited (NSCCL), Indian Clearing Corporation Limited (ICCL) and MCX  Stock Exchange Clearing Corporation Limited (CCL)} of the stock exchanges.
12. Loans / Buy-backs
Banks / FIs cannot grant loans against CDs.  Furthermore, they cannot buy-back their own CDs before maturity. However, the RBI may relax these restrictions  for temporary periods through a separate notification.
13. Format of CDs
Banks / FIs should issue CDs only in  dematerialised form. However, according to the Depositories Act, 1996,  investors have the option to seek certificate in physical form. Accordingly, if  an investor insists on physical certificate, the bank / FI may inform the Principal  Chief General Manager, Financial Markets Department, Reserve Bank of India,  Central Office, Fort, Mumbai - 400 001 about such instances separately.  Further, issuance of CDs will attract stamp duty. A format (Annex I) is  enclosed for adoption by banks / FIs. There will be no grace period for  repayment of CDs. If the maturity date happens to be a holiday, the issuing  bank/FI should make payment on the immediate preceding working day. Banks /  FIs, therefore, should fix the period of deposit in such a manner that the maturity  date does not coincide with a holiday to avoid loss of discount / interest  rate.
14. Security Aspect
Since CDs in physical form are freely  transferable by endorsement and delivery, it will be necessary for banks/FIs to  see that the certificates are printed on good quality security paper and  necessary precautions are taken to guard against tampering with the document.  They should be signed by two or more authorised signatories.
15. Payment of  Certificate
15.1 Since CDs are transferable, the  physical certificates may be presented for payment by the last holder. The  question of liability on account of any defect in the chain of endorsements may  arise. It is, therefore, desirable that banks take necessary precautions and  make payment only by a crossed cheque. Those who deal in these CDs may also be  suitably cautioned.
15.2  The holders of dematted CDs will approach their respective depository  participants (DPs) and give transfer / delivery instructions to transfer the  security represented by the specific International Securities Identification  Number (ISIN) to the 'CD Redemption Account' maintained by the issuer. The  holders should also communicate to the issuer by a letter / fax enclosing the  copy of the delivery instruction they had given to their respective DP and  intimate the place at which the payment is requested to facilitate prompt  payment. Upon receipt of the demat credit of CDs in the "CD Redemption  Account", the issuer, on maturity date, would arrange to repay to holders  / transferors by way of Banker's cheque / high value cheque, etc.
16. Issue of  Duplicate Certificates
16.1 In case of loss of physical certificates,  duplicate certificates can be issued after compliance with the following:
Notice is required to be given in at least one local  newspaper;
Lapse of a reasonable period (say 15 days) from the date of  the notice in the newspaper; and
Execution  of an indemnity bond by the investor to the satisfaction of the issuer of CDs.
16.2 The duplicate certificate should be issued  only in physical form. No fresh stamping is required as a duplicate certificate  is issued against the original lost CD. The duplicate CD should clearly state  that the CD is a Duplicate one stating the original value date, due date, and  the date of issue (as "Duplicate issued on ________").
17. Accounting
Banks / FIs may account the issue price under  the Head "CDs issued" and show it under deposits. Accounting entries  towards discount will be made as in the case of "Cash Certificates".  Banks / FIs should maintain a register of CDs issued with complete particulars.
18. Standardised  Market Practices and Documentation
Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives  Association of India (FIMMDA) may prescribe, in consultation with the RBI, for  operational flexibility and smooth functioning of the CD market, any  standardised procedure and documentation that are to be followed by the  participants, in consonance with the international best practices. Banks / FIs  may refer to the detailed guidelines issued by FIMMDA in this regard on June  20, 2002 and as amended from time to time (
http://fimmda.org
).
19. Reporting
19.1 Banks should include the amount  of CDs in the fortnightly return under Section 42 of the RBI Act, 1934 and also  separately indicate the amount so included by way of a footnote in the return.
19.2  Further, banks / FIs should report the data on issuance of CDs on the web-based  module under the Online Returns Filing System (ORFS) within 10 days from the  end of the fortnight to which it pertains.
