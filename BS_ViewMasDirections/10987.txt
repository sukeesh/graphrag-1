Dear Sir/Madam
Submission of Annual Information Return relating to issue of Bonds for ₹ 5 lakh or more under Section 285 BA of Income Tax Act, 1961-Change thereof
A reference is invited to our
circular IDMD.CDD.No. 3031/13.01.299/2016-17 dated May 25, 2017
on the captioned subject.
2. It is observed that a few Agency banks were submitting Annual Information Returns (AIR, now changed to SFT) in respect of Savings Bonds to Income Tax Authorities as well as to RBI. As RBI too, consolidates and submits this information to IT Department, and in order to avoid the duplication of data relating to Savings Bonds, Agency banks/SHCIL may henceforth ensure that the required information is furnished only to Public Debt Offices of the respective jurisdiction. They need not submit this information to Income Tax Authorities separately.
3. Instructions issued vide the circular ibid, stands modified to this effect.
Yours faithfully,
(Shyni Sunil)
Deputy General Manager
