CHAPTER – II
FORMAT OF THE BALANCE SHEET AND PROFIT & LOSS ACCOUNT
AND PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINACIAL STATEMENTS
3. The AIFIs shall, in respect of all business transacted by them, prepare a balance-sheet and profit and loss account as on the last working day of the year or the period, as the case may be, in the form and manner prescribed under the respective Acts governing their functioning.
4. In addition to solo level financial statements, the AIFIs shall also prepare and disclose Consolidated Financial Statements.
5. The Consolidated Financial Statements shall be prepared in terms of Accounting Standard (AS) 21 –Consolidated Financial Statements (CFS) and other related accounting standards – AS 23- Accounting for Investments in Associates in Consolidated Financial Statements and AS 27- Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint Ventures. For the purpose, the terms 'parent', 'subsidiary', ‘associate’, ‘joint venture’, 'control' and 'group' shall have the same meaning as ascribed to them in the above accounting standards.
6. A parent AIFI presenting CFS shall consolidate all subsidiaries - domestic as well as foreign, except those specifically permitted to be excluded under AS 21. The reasons for not consolidating a subsidiary shall be disclosed in CFS. The responsibility of determining whether a particular entity shall be included or not for consolidation would be that of the Management of the parent entity and the Statutory Auditors shall comment in this regard if they are of the opinion that an entity which ought to have been consolidated had been omitted.
7. CFS shall normally include consolidated balance sheet, consolidated statement of profit and loss, principal accounting policies and notes to accounts.
8. The financial statements used in the consolidation shall be drawn up as of the same reporting date. If that is not possible, AS 21 allows adoption of six month old balance sheet of subsidiaries and prescribes that adjustments shall be made for the effects of significant transactions or other events that have occurred during the intervening period. In case that the balance sheet dates of parent and subsidiaries are different, inter-group netting shall be done as on the balance sheet date of the parent entity. In the cases where the balance sheet date coincides with that of the AIFI, the AIFI shall publish its CFS without waiting for the audit of their subsidiaries by the Comptroller and Auditor General. However, the AIFI shall ensure completion of statutory audit of the accounts of such subsidiaries before consolidation with the parent’s accounts.
9. The CFS shall be prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. If it is not practicable to do so, that fact shall be disclosed together with the proportions of the items in the consolidated financial statements to which the different accounting policies have been applied. For the purpose of preparing the CFS using uniform accounting policies, the AIFIs shall rely on a Statement of Adjustments for non-uniform accounting policies, furnished by the Statutory Auditors of the subsidiaries.
10. In cases where different entities in a group are governed by different accounting norms laid down by the concerned regulator for different businesses, the AIFI shall use for consolidation purposes the rules and regulatory requirements applicable to the AIFIs in respect of like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. In situations where regulatory norms have been prescribed by RBI, the norms as applicable according to the accounting standards may be followed.
11. For the purpose of valuation, the investments in associates (other than those specifically excluded under AS 23) shall be accounted for under the "Equity Method" of accounting in accordance with AS 23.
12. The valuation of investments in subsidiaries which are not consolidated and associates which are excluded under AS 23, shall be as per the relevant valuation norms issued by the Reserve Bank of India. The valuation of investments in joint ventures shall be accounted for under the ‘proportionate consolidation’ method as per AS 27. The AIFIs may take into account the provisions of the accounting standards relating to the exclusion of subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures from consolidation under specific circumstances.
13. The solo level financial statements and the CFS shall be submitted to the Department of Banking Supervision, Reserve Bank of India within one month from the publication of the AIFI’s annual accounts.
