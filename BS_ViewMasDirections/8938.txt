Dear Sir/Madam,
Section 42(1) of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and
Section 18 & 24 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949  (AACS)-
FCNR (B)/NRE deposits – Exemption from Maintenance of  CRR/SLR
and Exclusion from ABC for Priority Sector Lending
Please refer to our
circular  UBD.BPD.(PCB).Cir.No.5/13.01.000//2013-14 dated August 27, 2013
, in terms  of which Urban Co-operative Banks  were  advised that with effect from fortnight beginning August 24, 2013, incremental  FCNR (B) deposits as also NRE deposits with reference to base date of July 26,  2013, and having maturity of three years and above, mobilised by them will be  exempt from maintenance of CRR and SLR. Further, advances extended in India against  such incremental FCNR (B) / NRE deposits qualifying for exemption from CRR/SLR  requirements will also be excluded from Adjusted Bank Credit for computation of  priority sector lending targets.
2. On a review, it has been decided that the exemption granted on  incremental FCNR (B) /NRE deposits from maintenance of CRR/SLR will be  withdrawn with effect from reporting fortnight beginning June 14, 2014, i.e.,  only the eligible amount of incremental FCNR (B) and NRE deposits of maturities  of three years and above from the base date of July 26, 2013, and outstanding  as on June 13, 2014, would qualify for CRR/SLR exemption till their maturities/  pre-mature withdrawals.
3. Further, advances extended in India against the above mentioned  incremental FCNR (B)/ NRE deposits, qualifying for exemption from CRR/ SLR  requirements, will be eligible for exclusion from Adjusted Bank Credit, till  their repayment, for computation of priority sector lending targets.
Yours faithfully,
(A.K.Bera)
