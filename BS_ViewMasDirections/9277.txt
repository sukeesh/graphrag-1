Madam / Dear Sir
Review of norms for classification  of Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) as Financially Sound and Well Managed (FSWM)
Please refer to our
circular  UBD.CO.LS.(PCB).Cir.No.24/07.01.000/2013-14 dated October 1, 2013
wherein  the eligibility criteria for FSWM UCBs were laid down.
2. In this  connection, attention of UCBs is invited to our circular ref:
UBD.CO.BPD.PCB.Cir.No.14/09.18.300/2013-14  dated September 11, 2013
in terms of which UCBs were advised to implement  CBS in all their branches on or before December 31, 2013 failing which no  further facilities by way of branch expansion etc. may be granted. In view of  the critical importance of CBS in the banking system, it has now been decided  to include CBS implementation as an additional criterion for a UCB to be  classified as an FSWM bank. Accordingly, UCBs fulfilling the following criteria  would henceforth be termed as FSWM:
(a) CRAR of not less than 10 per cent;
(b) Gross NPA of less than 7 % and  Net NPAs of not more than 3%
(c)  Net profit for at least three out of the preceding four years subject to  it not 
  having incurred a net loss in the immediate preceding year.
(d) No default in the maintenance of CRR  / SLR during the preceding financial year;
(e) Sound internal control system with  at least two professional directors on the Board;
(f) Core Banking Solution (CBS) fully  implemented;
and,
(g) Regulatory Comfort
3. With a view to  imparting transparency and removing any unintended element of subjectivity in  the interpretation of the criterion of regulatory comfort, it is hereby  clarified that such UCBs should have a proven record of compliance with the  provisions of Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (AACS), Reserve Bank of India Act,  1934 and the instructions / directions issued by RBI from time to time i.e. the  bank should have an impeccable record of regulatory compliance and no warning  letter / cautionary advice should have been issued to or monetary penalty  imposed on the bank on account of violation of RBI directives / guidelines  during the preceding three financial years.
4. The new criteria  would henceforth be considered for processing applications received from UCBs  for opening of on-site / off-site / mobile ATMs, applications under Annual  Business Plans (ABP), extension of area of operation, shifting of premises and all  other permissions from RBI.
Yours faithfully,
(A. K. Bera)
