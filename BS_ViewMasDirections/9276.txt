Madam / Dear Sir,
Usage of ATMs –Rationalisation of number of free  transactions - Clarifications
A reference is invited to the
circular  DPSS.CO.PD.No. 316/02.10.002/2014-2015 dated August 14, 2014
on the  captioned subject. The circular, inter alia, advises that the number of mandatory  free ATM transactions (inclusive of both financial and non-financial  transactions) for savings bank account customers at other banks’ ATMs is  reduced from the present five to three transactions per month for transactions carried  out at the ATMs located in six metro centres, viz. Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai,  Kolkata, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.
2. We have been receiving references from  various stakeholders requesting clarifications as regards the total number of  free ATM transactions that banks have to mandatorily provide to their customers  in other bank’s ATM from November 1, 2014. In this connection, it is clarified  as under:
Prior to the issuance of the latest instructions,  banks were mandated not to charge any fees to their savings bank account  customers for five ATM transactions (inclusive of both financial and  non-financial) in a month carried out at other bank ATMs
irrespective of the  location of the ATMs
. With the issuance of the latest instructions while  this overall cap remains unchanged, THREE transactions (inclusive of both  financial and non-financial) would be free of charge if carried out at other  bank ATMs located in six metro centres,viz., Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai,  Kolkata, Bengaluru and Hyderabad. Accordingly, if transactions are carried out  at both the six metro centres and other locations, the total number of  transactions (inclusive of both financial and non-financial) free of charge at  other bank ATMs would continue to remain at
FIVE
.
3. As indicated in the above circular dated  August 14, 2014, banks are,however, free to offer more number of free transactions  per month at other bank ATMs as well as own ATMs in any geographical location.  Banks are also free to decide on the combination (for metro & non-metro  locations) of free transactions while adhering to the minimum requirements.
4. Further, attention is drawn to the provisions  indicated in
para  4.1(iv)
of RBI Master Circular (on Customer Service in Banks)  RBI/2014-15/72 DBOD No. Leg.BC.21/09.07.006/2014-15 dated July 1, 2014 placing  certain restrictions on the number of withdrawals permitted in small/no  frills/basic savings bank deposit accounts, including ATM withdrawals, during a  month. It is clarified that the applicability of free transactions (inclusive  of both financial and non-financial) at other bank ATMs to small / no frills /  basic savings deposit account holders as indicated in our circular dated August  14, 2014 is subject to the provisions indicated in the above Master Circular as  amended from time to time.
5. Other provisions of circular dated August 14,  2014 will remain unchanged.
6. The directive is issued under Section 10(2)  read with Section 18 of Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 (Act 51 of  2007).
Yours  faithfully
