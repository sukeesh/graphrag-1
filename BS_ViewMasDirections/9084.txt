2. In this regard, it has come to the notice of  Reserve Bank that some banks are yet to complete the allotment of UCIC and  accordingly have sought some more time. In  view of the requests received, it has been decided to extend the time for  completing the process of allotting UCIC to existing customers up to December  31, 2014.
3. UCBs are, therefore, advised to expedite the  procedure and complete the work of allotting UCIC to all the existing  individual customers, within the stipulated timeframe. They may chalk out a  plan for completing the work and furnish the monthly progress report to their  Board. Considering the fact that a  period of two years has been allotted for completion of the task, no further  extension in this regard would be considered.
4. It is mandatory for banks to comply with these  instructions and non-compliance would invite penal consequences.
Yours faithfully,
(P.K. Arora)
