Madam/Dear Sir,
Prudential Norms on Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning pertaining to Advances – Spread over of shortfall
Please refer to our
circular DBOD.BP.BC.No.98/21.04.132/2013-14 dated February 26, 2014
wherein paragraph 3.4 states that “As an incentive for early sale of NPAs, banks can spread over any shortfall, if the sale value is lower than the NBV, over a period of two years. This facility of spreading over the shortfall would however be available for NPAs sold up to March 31, 2015 and will be subject to necessary disclosures in the Notes to Account in Annual Financial Statements of the banks.”
2. It has now been decided to extend this dispensation for assets sold on or after March 31, 2015 and up to March 31, 2016.
Yours faithfully,
(Sudarshan Sen)
Chief General Manager-in-Charge
