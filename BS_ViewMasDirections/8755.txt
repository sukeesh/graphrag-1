Dear Sir/Madam,
Call/Notice Money Market Operations
It has been decided to dispense  with the extant practice of Banks/ PDs/ Co-operative banks approaching RBI for  fixing of prudential limits for transactions in Call / Notice Money Market. Banks/PDs/  Co-operative banks may, with the approval of their Boards, arrive at the  prudential limits for borrowing/lending in Call/Notice Money Market in terms of  the IDMD Master Circular dated July 01, 2013. The limits so arrived at may be  conveyed to the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL) for setting of limits  in NDS-CALL System, under advice to Financial Markets Department (FMD), Reserve  Bank of India. This circular comes into effect from March 03, 2014.
Yours faithfully
(K.K. Vohra)
Principal Chief General Manager
