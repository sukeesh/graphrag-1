Inter-bank exposures  including inter-bank off-balance sheet exposures will not be taken into account  for the purpose of priority sector lending targets / sub-targets.
The  targets and sub-targets set under priority sector lending for UCBs are  furnished below. The stipulation  regarding priority sector lending is not applicable to the Salary Earners'  Banks.

These States / Union Territories are Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab,  Sikkim, Mizoram, Nagaland  and Lakshadweep. UCBs  should initiate steps to enhance / augment flow of credit under priority sector  to artisans and craftsmen as also to vegetable vendors, cart pullers, cobblers,  etc. belonging to minority communities. The minority communities notified in  this regard are Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, Zoroastrians and Buddhists. Within the overall target for priority sector lending and  the sub-target of 25 per cent for the weaker sections, sufficient care may be  taken to ensure that the minority communities also receive an equitable portion  of the credit.
V. Priority  Sector-Data Reporting System
A  robust reporting system with granularity and system generation of priority  sector data is of utmost importance for proper monitoring and appropriate  policy making.
In order to ensure that due emphasis is given to lending under priority  sector, it is considered desirable that the performance is reviewed  periodically. For this purpose, apart from the usual reviews, which the banks  are periodically undertaking, specific reviews by the Board of Directors of the  respective banks may be made on half-yearly basis. Accordingly, a memorandum  may be submitted to the Board of Directors at half-yearly intervals i.e. as on  September 30 and March 31 of each year giving a detailed critical account of  the performance of the bank during the period showing increase / decrease over  the previous half-year (Statement  I).
Further, annual review of the performance under priority sector advances  as on March 31 may also be placed before the Board (Statement  II-part A) by 15th of the following  financial year. A copy of the annual review (Statement  II, part A to E) complete in all respect  as on March 31 may be forwarded to the concerned Regional Office of the Reserve  Bank with the Board's observations, indicating the steps taken / proposed to be  taken for improving the bank's performance. The report should reach the  Regional Office within a period of 15 days from the end of the period to which  it relates.
The banks should submit Statement  III (part A and B) as on March 31 within 15  days thereafter showing the position of direct loan and advances to agriculture  and allied activities to the concerned Regional Office of this department under  whose jurisdiction they function.
In  order to facilitate compilation of the relative figures, banks may maintain a  register to indicate all the items of priority sector advances and also another  register for weaker section advances showing particulars, with separate folios  to each activity so that the total of advances to priority sector and weaker  sections under each activity and to each type of beneficiary may be available  at any given point of time. The proforma of these registers may be on the lines  of the annual return to be submitted to RBI.
VI. Common  guidelines for priority sector loans
Banks  should comply with the following common guidelines for all categories of  advances under the priority sector.
1.  Service charges
No loan  related and adhoc service charges/inspection charges should be levied on  priority sector loans up to
`
25,000/-.
2.  Receipt, Sanction/Rejection/Disbursement Register
A  register/ electronic record should be maintained by the bank, wherein the date  of receipt, sanction/rejection/disbursement with reasons thereof, etc., should  be recorded. The register/electronic record should be made available to all  inspecting agencies.
3. Issue of  Acknowledgement of Loan Applications
Banks  should provide acknowledgement for loan applications received under priority  sector loans. Bank Boards should prescribe a time limit within which the bank  communicates its decision in writing to the applicants.
VII.  Amendments
These  guidelines are subject to any instructions that may be issued by the RBI from  time to time.
VIII.  Definitions
Small and Marginal Farmers
: Farmers with landholding  of up to 1 hectare are considered as Marginal Farmers. Farmers with a  landholding of more than 1 hectare but less than 2 hectares are considered as  Small Farmers. For the purpose of priority sector loans ‘small and marginal farmers’  include landless agricultural labourers, tenant farmers, oral lessees and  share-croppers, whose share of landholding is within above limits prescribed  for “Small and Marginal Farmer”.
