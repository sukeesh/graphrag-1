Madam / Dear Sir,
Lending to Public Sector Undertakings
It has been observed that a few Urban  Cooperative Banks (UCBs) have been sanctioning high value loans to Public  Sector Undertakings (PSUs) by admitting them as nominal members or otherwise.
2. As you are aware, UCBs are meant primarily to  meet the credit needs of the society by providing loans and advances to low/middle income groups (small borrowers), agriculture and small businesses for  furthering the cause of cooperation. Grant of high value loans to PSUs is not  consistent with the co-operative principles and dilutes the cooperative  character of UCBs.
3. In view of the above, UCBs are advised, as a matter  of principle, generally not to grant large value loans to Public Sector/Government Undertakings.
Yours faithfully,
(P K Arora)
