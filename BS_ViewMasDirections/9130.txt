To
AllÂ  Authorised Persons
Madam/  Sir,
Issue of Prepaid Forex Cards- Due Diligence and Adherence to KYC norms
Attention of all the Authorised Persons in foreign exchange is invited  to Para 2 of the
A. P.  (DIR Series) Circular No. 104 dated April 04, 2012
.
2. It has been brought to  our notice that some authorised dealers / full-fledged money changers may  neither be exercising due diligence nor adhering to KYC norms while selling  prepaid foreign currency cards (issued by a few select banks) to their  customers.
3. In this connection, it  is clarified that prepaid foreign currency cards are a form of foreign  currency, similar to foreign currency notes or travellers cheques. As such, the  authorised dealers/FFMCs selling pre-paid foreign currency cards for travel  purposes are required to comply with the same rigorous standards of due  diligence and KYC as they would in case they were selling foreign currency  notes/ travellers cheques to their customers.
4. The directions contained in this  Circular have been issued under Section 10(4) and Section 11(1) of the Foreign  Exchange Management Act, 1999 (42 of 1999), as amended from time to time and  are without prejudice to permission /approvals, if any, required under any  other law.
Yours faithfully,
(C. D. Srinivasan)
